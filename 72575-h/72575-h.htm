<p class="dropcap">I had been dreaming of the
ghost, and was conscious in a
moment, and sitting up in bed.
Whatever I had thought of
Bessie’s tales before, I believed them now,
for I could distinctly hear the low, gasping
breath which follows an inordinate fit of
sobbing, drawn apparently close to us.</p>

<p>‘What time is it?’ I exclaimed.</p>

<p>‘It is just three. I have been listening
to it for some time, but did not like to rouse
you till I was sure. Is the door locked?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; but I will unlock it at once,’ I
said, springing out of bed.</p>

<p>‘No, no! pray do not,’ cried Bessie,
clinging to me. ‘What are you doing?
It might come into the room.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<p>‘My dear Bessie, if it is a ghost, no
locks can keep it out; and if it is not a
ghost, what harm can it do us by entering?
Pray be reasonable. We shall never clear
up this mystery if we are not a little brave!’</p>

<p>I shook her off, and approached the door,
whilst she rushed back to her own bed.</p>

<p>I confess that as I turned the key in
the lock I felt very nervous. Do what
we will, it is hard to accustom ourselves
to think lightly of communication with the
dead; neither did I relish the idea of a
trick being played us in that lonely house
at dead of night. The light was burning
brightly in my room, but as I threw the
door open, the corridor seemed dark and
empty. I stood upon the threshold and
looked from right to left. What was that
white, tall shadow in the doorway of the
spare room?</p>

<p>I called out, ‘Who are you? What do
you want?’ The answer I received was
a quick sob and a rustle. Then I saw an
indistinct figure move down the passage
with a hurried step, and disappear somewhere
at the further end.</p>

<p>Shall I confess that for all my boasted
strength I had not the courage to follow
it? It was one thing to have stood on
the threshold of my lighted room and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
addressed the apparition, and another to
venture out into the cold and darkness in
pursuit of it. I retreated to Bessie’s bedroom
instead.</p>

<p>‘I have seen it!’ I exclaimed. ‘I
believe that you are right, Bessie, and for
the first time in my life I have seen a
ghost. I meant to have followed it; but
I really felt I couldn’t. To-morrow night I
may have more courage. But hark! what
is that noise? Isn’t it baby crying?’</p>

<p>‘Never mind <i>baby</i>; Mrs Graham will
attend to him,’ said Bessie. ‘Lock the
door again, Dolly dear, do, and get into
bed with me, or I sha’n’t sleep another
wink to-night. I’m shaking from head to
foot as it is.’</p>

<p>But the cries from baby’s room became
more distinct; and my courage had returned
to me.</p>

<p>‘Let me go and see what is the matter
with little Dick first,’ I said, taking up the
lighted candle.</p>

<p>Bessie yelled at being kept alone in the
dark, but I could not have lain down again
without ascertaining what ailed the little
fellow; so, disregarding her remonstrances,
I walked off to Mrs Graham’s room. Her
door was unlocked, and I entered without
knocking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>The child was still crying lustily; and
what was my surprise to find his nurse,
utterly regardless of the noise, sitting up in
bed, with scared wide-open eyes, talking
vehemently.</p>

<p>‘Go away!’ she was exclaiming in a loud
voice; ‘Go away! and don’t come back
again. You let the water in each time you
open the door: I tell you we don’t want
you! Go away, I say, and <i>don’t come back
again</i>!’</p>

<p>She halted for a moment at this juncture,
and I was about to waken her from what I
perceived was a nightmare, when she
suddenly clapped her hands before her eyes
and screamed.</p>

<p>‘Ah, Heavens! a wave—a fearful wave
that covers the deck—that covers everything.
Where is he? Where is he gone
to? I have sent him to his death!
Edward! Edward! come back to me! I
didn’t mean it—I didn’t mean it! Ah!
Lord have pity on me.’</p>

<p>Her agitation was rising so rapidly, and
the baby was crying so violently, that I
thought it time to interfere.</p>

<p>‘Mrs Graham!’ I exclaimed, shaking
her by the arm, ‘wake up. Don’t you hear
the baby wants you?’</p>

<p>She turned her big eyes upon me in such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
a pitiful vacuous way. Then she recognised
me, and looked frightened.</p>

<p>‘Have I been dreaming? Have I been
saying anything? Oh! I am so sorry,’
she said apologetically, as she caught up
the child and held it to her breast.</p>

<p>‘You have only been talking a little in
your sleep,’ I replied soothingly; ‘don’t be
alarmed; you said nothing out of the
common way, and there is no one here but
myself.’</p>

<p>She did not answer, but as she held the
child I saw how her arms trembled.</p>

<p>‘Your agitation is the worst thing
possible for the baby, you know; and you
must try and calm yourself for his sake,’ I
continued.</p>

<p>‘I should be so sorry to hurt him,’ she
murmured; ‘and I will try and not dream
again, if it is possible.’</p>

<p>‘Shall I fetch you anything?’</p>

<p>‘Oh no, madam, thank you. The best
thing I can do is to go to sleep again.
There is nothing for me but sleep—and
prayer,’ she added in a whisper.</p>

<p>I felt deeply interested in this young
woman. There was an air of patient
mournfulness about her that betokened
deep suffering; and as I returned to my
room I resolved to do my best to be of use<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
to her. She so completely occupied my
thoughts, indeed, that I had forgotten all
about the ghost, till Bessie asked me how
I could possibly walk through the corridor
with so composed a step.</p>

<p>‘My dear, I was thinking about baby
and his nurse, and quite forgot to be
frightened. Yes, they are all right now,
and going to sleep again comfortably; and
I think the ghost must have followed their
example, for certainly there were no signs
of its presence as I returned: so I think
we had better try to make up for our broken
rest by a few hours’ sleep.’</p>

<p>Bessie was quite ready to do so; but for
my own part I lay awake until the loitering
dawn broke through the shuttered
windows.</p>

<p>Mr Maclean’s absence was really, I
found, not to be prolonged beyond the two
nights; so I could write Dick word to
fetch me home on the following day; but
I resolved, before I went, to have some
sort of explanatory conversation with Mrs
Graham, with respect to her dream of the
night before. I told nothing of it to
Bessie; for I felt she would spoil everything
perhaps by her awkwardness in
handling the subject, or wound the poor
girl’s feelings by too abrupt a reference to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
her grief. But I watched Mrs Graham
leave the house at about eleven o’clock
to take her little charge out for his morning
walk, and as soon as Bessie descended
to the kitchen quarters to give her orders
for the day, I put on my bonnet and shawl
and ran after the nurse. There was a
cold wind blowing from the north, and I
knew I should find her in the sheltered
shrubbery, where she had been told to take
the child. It extended for some distance,
and when I came up with her we were
quite out of sight and hearing of the house.</p>

<p>‘A fine cold morning!’ I remarked, by
way of a beginning.</p>

<p>‘Very cold, madam.’</p>

<p>‘With the wind in the north. A nasty
day for the sea—I pity the ships in the
channel.’</p>

<p>To this she made no response.</p>

<p>‘Have you ever been on the sea, Mrs
Graham?’</p>

<p>‘Yes! once!’ with a shudder.</p>

<p>‘And did you like it?’</p>

<p>‘Like it? Oh! for God’s sake, madam,
don’t speak of it, for I cannot bear the
thought even.’</p>

<p>‘You were unfortunate, perhaps? You
had experience of a storm? But the sea
is not always rough, Mrs Graham.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>She was silent, and I looked in her face,
and saw the tears streaming down it.</p>

<p>‘My dear girl,’ I said, placing my hand
on her shoulder, ‘don’t think me unkind.
I have guessed somewhat of your history,
and I feel for you—oh, so deeply. Confide
in me; my husband is a man of influence,
and I may be of use to you. I
see that you are superior to the position
you hold, and I have conceived an interest
in you. Don’t keep your sorrows locked
in your own breast, or they will eat out
your very heart and life.’</p>

<p>As I spoke she began to sob piteously.</p>

<p>‘You are not doing right by this poor
little baby, nor his parents,’ I continued,
‘by brooding over a silent grief. You will
injure his health, when perhaps if you will
tell us all, we may be able to comfort you.’</p>

<p>‘No one can comfort me, madam! I am
beyond all relief.’</p>

<p>‘No one dare say that in this world,
which God rules according to His will.
You cannot tell what solace He may hold
in the future for you.’</p>

<p>‘I have no future,’ she said sadly. ‘If
you think I am likely to injure this little
one,’ pressing it tightly to her bosom, ‘I
am very, very sorry; but to have something
to love and care for, seemed to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
the only thing to prevent my going
mad.’</p>

<p>‘Mrs Graham, I don’t wish to be impertinently
curious, but I want to hear
your story. Won’t you tell it to me?’</p>

<p>‘If you do, you will hate me—as I hate
myself.’</p>

<p>‘I hardly think that possible. Of what
crime can you be guilty, to accuse yourself
so bitterly.’</p>

<p>‘<i>I am a murderess!</i>’</p>

<p>She brought out the words so vehemently
that I started. Was it possible
she spoke the truth? And yet I had seen
in our gaol, such young and superior-looking
criminals, that I knew it <i>might</i> be possible.
My thoughts flew at once to her child.</p>

<p>‘Was it the baby?’ I cried. ‘Oh! my
poor child! what drove you to such an
awful deed?’</p>

<p>‘Do you pity me still?’</p>

<p>‘I pity you with all my heart.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! madam; you are too good.’</p>

<p>She trembled so violently that I had
taken the child from her arms, and as I
stood there in the wintry path, she sank
down upon her knees before me and kissed
the border of my shawl, and hid her face
in it and cried.</p>

<p>‘Mrs Graham, I cannot believe it!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>‘No! you need not believe it. In that
sense I did not kill my child. God took
it away from me in anger; but I sent its
father, my dearly-loved husband, to his
death.’</p>

<p>‘Sent him to his death!’</p>

<p>‘Ah, madam! have pity on me and listen.
We had been married but six months, and
we loved each other, ah! so dearly. He
was a clerk in a city firm, and his employers
sent him over to Ireland on business.
We could not bear to part—we
went together. In order to return to
England we embarked in a small sailing
vessel, and we had a fearful storm in
crossing. The sea ran mountains high,
and the women on board were assembled
together in a deck cabin. The men to
whom they belonged kept looking in every
now and then to tell them how we were
getting on, and every time the door of the
cabin was opened, the sea rushed in and
wetted them. They grew impatient, I the
most of all; and when my dear husband,
in his anxiety lest I should be frightened
at our danger, put his head in for the third
or fourth time I called out, saying, ‘Go
away, Edward, and <i>don’t come back again</i>.’
And he went away, and he never did come
back. Ah, Heaven! have mercy upon me!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>‘My poor girl! how did it happen?’</p>

<p>‘He was washed off the deck, madam,
by a huge wave that nearly swamped the
ship—so they told me afterwards. But I
never saw him more! The glimpse I had of
his bonnie face as it was thrust in at the half-opened
door, beaming with love and anxiety,
was the last glimpse I was ever to have in
this world—and I sent him to his death. I
said, ‘Go away, and don’t come back’—and
he never came back!—he never came back!’</p>

<p>Her grief was so violent I almost thought
she would have swooned at my feet. I
tried to direct her thoughts in another
direction.</p>

<p>‘Have you no friends to go to, Mrs
Graham?’</p>

<p>‘None of my own, madam. I was a
soldier’s orphan from the Home when
Edward married me. And I could not go
to his.’</p>

<p>‘How did you lose your baby?’</p>

<p>‘It died of my grief, I suppose; it only
lived a few days. And then they advised
me at the hospital to get a situation as wet
nurse; and I thought the care of an infant
might soothe me a little. But my sorrow
is past cure.’</p>

<p>‘You have bad dreams at night, I fear.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! such awful dreams! He is always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
calling me—calling me to go to him, and I
can find him nowhere; or else I am in
the ship again, and see that which I never
did see—the cruel wave that washed him
from me!’</p>

<p>‘Do you feel strong enough to take the
child again?’</p>

<p>She had risen by this time, and was,
comparatively speaking, calm. She held
out her arms mechanically. I put the baby
in them, and then stooped and kissed her
swollen eyes and burning forehead.</p>

<p>‘I will not discuss this subject with you
further to-day,’ I said; ‘but you have
found a friend. Go on with your walk,
child, and may God comfort you. I am
glad you have told me the story of your
grief.’</p>

<p>I hurried back to Bessie, fearful lest she
might come in search of me, and insist
upon hearing the reason of Mrs Graham’s
tears. There was no doubt of one thing—another
nurse must be found as soon as
possible for little Dick, and I must take on
myself the responsibility of providing for
his present one. But all that required my
husband’s permission and advice, and I
must wait till I had seen and confided in
him.</p>

<p>Bessie, who had discovered that, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
my deplorable deficiency in
the way of children, I could cut out their
garments far better than she could do herself,
had provided a delightful entertainment
for me in the shape of half-a-dozen
frocks to be made ready for the nurse’s
hands, and the whole afternoon was spent
in snipping and piecing and tacking together.
But I didn’t grumble; my mind
was too much occupied with poor Mrs
Graham and her pathetic story. I thought
of it so much that the temporary fear
evoked by the apparition of the night
before had totally evaporated. In the
presence of a real, substantial human grief,
we can hardly spare time for imaginary
horrors.</p>

<p>As bed-time recurred, and Bessie and I
locked ourselves into our stronghold, I
refused the half of the bed she offered me,
and preferred to retain my own. I even
made up my mind, if possible, not to sleep,
but to watch for the mysterious sounds,
and be the first to investigate them.
So I would not put out my candle, but lay
in bed reading long after Bessie’s snores
had announced her departure to the land
of dreams.</p>

<p>I had come to the end of my book, my
candle, and my patience, and was just about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
to give up the vigil as a failure, when I
heard footsteps distinctly sounding along
the corridor. I was out of bed in a
moment, with my hand upon the lock of
the door. I waited till the steps had
passed my room, and then I turned the
key and looked gently out. The same
white figure I had seen the night before
was standing a little beyond me, its course
arrested, as it would appear, by the slight
sound of unlocking the door.</p>

<p>‘Now or never,’ I thought to myself.
‘Dick always says I am the bravest woman
he ever met, and I will try and prove him
true. Why should I be afraid? Even if
this <i>is</i> a spirit, God is over <span class="smcap">it</span> and us,
alike!’</p>

<p>So I stepped out into the passage, just
as I should sit down to have a tooth drawn.
The figure had recommenced walking, and
was some paces farther from me. I followed
it, saying softly, ‘What are you?
Speak to me.’ But it did not turn, but
went on, clasping its hands, and talking
rapidly to itself.</p>

<p>A sudden thought flashed across my
mind. In a moment I felt sure that I was
right, and had solved the mystery of
Poplar Farm. I placed myself full in the
path of the apparition, and as the end of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
the corridor forced it to turn and retrace its
steps, I met face to face my poor, pretty
Mrs Graham, with the flaxen hair she
usually kept concealed beneath her widow’s
cap, streaming over her shoulders and
giving her a most weird and unearthly
appearance.</p>

<p>‘Edward! Edward!’ she was whispering
in a feverish, uncertain manner, ‘where are
you? It is so dark here and so cold. Put
out your hand and lead me. I want to come
to you, darling; I want to come to you.’</p>

<p>I stretched out my own hand and took
hers. She clung to me joyfully.</p>

<p>‘Is it you?’ she exclaimed, in the undisturbed
voice of a sleep-walker. ‘Have
I found you again? Oh, Edward! I have
been trying to find you for so long—so
long, and I thought we were parted for
ever.’</p>

<p>I drew her gently along to her own room
and put her in her bed, whilst she continued
to talk to me in the fond, low tones in
which she thought she was addressing her
dead husband.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Bessie slept through it all.</p>

<p>Of course I told her all about it next
day, and equally, of course, she did not
believe half what I said. She did not like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
the idea of parting with her cherished
grievance in the shape of the ghost, nor
having the trouble of changing her wet
nurse. So I left her, as soon as ever Dick
arrived, rather disgusted with the manner
in which she had received my efforts for
her good, but still determined to do what I
could in the way of befriending Mrs
Graham. As I told her the last thing,
when I ran up to the nursery to say good-bye
to little Dick, and received her grateful
thanks in reply. ‘Only nothing,’ she
said with a deep sigh, ‘could ever do her
any good in this world again.’</p>

<p>‘But I’m determined to get her out of
Poplar Farm,’ I said to Dick, as we drove
homeward, after I had told him this long-winded
story. ‘She’s killing the baby and
herself too. She ought to have a much
more cheerful home and active employment.
Now, can’t you think of something
for her to do about the gaol or the hospital,
like a dear, darling old boy as you are?’</p>

<p>‘Well, I don’t quite see how you can
take Mrs Maclean’s servant away from her
against her will, Dolly. If Mrs Graham
leaves, it will be a different thing; but as
things are, I’m afraid you ought not to
interfere.’</p>

<p>I called him a wretch; but I knew he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
was right for all that, and determined to
take his advice and wait patiently to see
how things turned out. And, as it happened,
I had not long to wait, for a week
afterwards I received this doleful epistle
from Bessie:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">My dear Dolly</span>,—I am perfectly
miserable; nothing ever goes right with
me. Tom threw Charlie out of the wheel-barrow
yesterday, and cut his forehead
right across. He will be scarred for life.
And nurse has entirely spoiled those frocks
you were so kind as to cut out for Lily and
Bessie. She is so obstinate, she would
have her own way, and the children positively
cannot get into them. But the
worst news of all is, that Mrs Graham is
going to leave me, and I have had to wean
baby, and put him on the bottle.’</p>
</div>

<p>‘Hurrah!’ I cried, ‘it’s all right. I shall
get that poor child here after all, and
be able to patch up her broken life.
No, I sha’n’t, though,’ I continued, as
I went on reading, and then, to my husband’s
astonishment, I fell on his neck, and
burst into tears. ‘Oh, Dick, Dick, Dick, I
<i>am</i> so glad!’</p>

<p>‘Halloa! what’s up now?’ said that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
vulgar Dick, in his own way of expressing
things.</p>

<p>‘My darling, she’s got him again.’</p>

<p>‘Who’s got which?’</p>

<p>‘Mrs Graham’s husband has returned.
He wasn’t drowned, but let me finish the
letter,’ and drying my eyes I went on—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Just imagine how awkward and unpleasant
for me. The other evening there
was an awful screaming in the kitchen,
and when I went down, I found Mrs
Graham fainted dead away in the arms of
a man. I was very angry at first, naturally;
but when she recovered I found it
was her husband whom she thought was
drowned at sea three months ago. It seems
he was picked up insensible by some ship,
and taken to Spain, where he had a fever,
and was delirious, and all that sort of thing;
and when he recovered, he worked his way
home before the mast, and had only just
found out where his wife lived. But I
think it is excessively unreasonable of
people to take situations, and say they’re
widows, and then—’</p>
</div>

<p>‘Oh, don’t read any more of that rubbish,
for heaven’s sake!’ said Dick, irreverently.
‘The long and the short of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
matter is, that the girl’s got her man
again.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! I <i>am</i> so thankful!’ I exclaimed,
with the tears still in my eyes; I couldn’t
help it, they <i>would</i> come. ‘Poor child!
poor, desolate, heart-broken child! What
a heaven earth must appear to her to-day.
Dick, will you drive me over to the farm
directly after breakfast? I want to see
her and congratulate her.’</p>

<p>‘You seem to take a vast interest in this
Mrs Graham, and her joys and sorrows,’
said Dick; ‘why is it, Dolly?’</p>

<p>‘Because I can sympathise with them so
deeply. Because—because—oh, Dick, <i>you</i>
know—because God has given me—you,
and I am the very happiest woman in all
the world.’</p>

<p class="dropcap">On the east coast of the county
of Norfolk, there lay a village
which shall be distinguished by
the name of Corston. It was
bounded on the one side by the sea, on
the other by the open country, and beside
the two or three gentleman farmers whose
possessions comprised all the agricultural
land within a radius of five miles, it could
boast of a church and resident parson—a
coastguard with its attendant officer, and
above all, close contiguity with Rooklands,
the estate of the Earl of Worcester. And
those who are acquainted with the moral
and social aspect, as it existed forty or fifty
years ago, of the more insignificant villages
of Norfolk, will acknowledge that Corston
was favoured above its fellows. The sea
coast in its vicinity brought many a gay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
riding party over from Rooklands, either
to enjoy the fresh breezes, or to bathe in
the sparkling waves from some sequestered
nook, whilst the congregation of the church
was made up of drafts from some four or
five outlying hamlets which had not the
advantage of a place of worship of their
own. Conceive then what a much larger
audience the Corston parson could depend
upon, when the women had a prospect of
seeing the bonnets from ten miles round
(to say nothing of a chance of the Rookland
aristocrats taking it into their heads
to drive out), in addition to listening to his
somewhat uninteresting sermons. The
coastguard, too, was a cause of constant
excitement, on account of the Admiralty
having been in the habit of bestowing the
appointment on old, worn-out, half-pay
lieutenants who chose to expire almost as
soon as they obtained it, and really, notwithstanding
the church and the parson
and Rooklands, there was not much in
Corston worth living for. But at the time
this story opens, the charge of the coast
had not long been put in the hands of
(comparatively speaking) a young and hale
man who bid fair to keep anybody else out
of it for a long while to come. His office
was no sinecure though, for, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
the difficulty of landing, the coast was
a celebrated one for smugglers, and as soon
as the dark months of winter set in there
was no lack of work for the preventive
officers. For the village of Corston did
not, of itself, run down to the sea. Between
it and the ocean there lay the salt
marshes, a bleak, desolate tract of land,
which no skill or perseverance could reclaim
from apparent uselessness. Except
to the samphire and cockle-gatherers, the
salt marshes of Corston were an arid wilderness
which could yield no fruit. Many
a farmer had looked longingly across the
wide waste which terminated only with the
shingled beach, and wondered if it were
possible to utilise it. But as it had been
from the beginning, so it remained until
that day; its stinted vegetation affording
shelter for sea-fowl and smugglers’ booty
only, and its brackish waters that flowed
and ebbed with the tides, tainting the best
springs on the level ground of Corston.
It was the existence of these marshes that
rendered the coastguard necessary to the
village, which would otherwise have become
a perfect nest of smugglers. As it
was, notwithstanding all the vigilance of
Mr John Burton and his men, many a keg
of spirits and roll of tobacco were landed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
on the coast of Corston, and many a
man in the place was marked by them
as guilty, though never discovered. For
they who had lived by the salt marshes all
their lives were cunning as to their properties,
and knew just where they might bury
their illegal possessions with impunity when
the tide was low, and find them safe when
it had flowed and ebbed again. Everyone
was not so fortunate. Lives had been lost
in the marshes before now—ay, and of
Corston men too, and several dark tales
were told by the gossips of the village of
the quagmires and quicksands that existed
in various parts of them, which looked,
although they never were, both firm and
dry, but had the power to draw man and
horse with the temerity to step upon them,
into their unfathomable depths. But if the
smugglers kept Mr Burton and his men
fully occupied on the sea shore, the poachers
did no less for Lord Worcester’s band of
gamekeepers at Rooklands; and Farmer
Murray, who had a drop of Scotch blood
running in his veins, and was never so
much alive as when his own interests were
concerned, had only saved his game for
the last three years by having been fortunate
enough to take the biggest poacher in
Corston, red-handed, and let him off on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
condition that he became his keeper and
preserved his covers from future violence.
‘Set a thief to catch a thief’ is a time-honoured
saying, and Farmer Murray found
it answer. Isaac Barnes, the unscrupulous
poacher, became a model gamekeeper, and
the midnight rest of the inhabitants of
Mavis Farm had never been disturbed by
a stray shot since; though the eldest son,
George Murray, had been heard to affirm
that half the fun of his life was gone now
that there was no chance of a tussle with
the poachers. Such was the state of Corston
some forty years ago. The villagers
were rough, uneducated, and lawless, and
the general condition of the residents,
vapid and uninteresting enough to have
provoked any amount of wickedness, if
only for the sake of change or excitement.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was the end of September, and the
close of a glorious summer. The harvest
had been abundant and the Norfolk soil,
which knows so well how to yield her
fruits in due season, was like an exhausted
mother which had just been delivered of
her abundance. The last sheaves of golden
corn were standing in the fields ready to
be carried to the threshing-barn, the trees
in the orchards were weighed down with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
their wealth of pears and apples, and in
every lane clusters of bare-headed children
with their hands full of nuts and their faces
stained with blackberry juice, proved how
nature had showered her bounties on rich
and poor alike. Lizzie Locke, who was
making her way slowly in the direction of
the village, with a huge basket on her arm,
stopped more than once to wipe her hot
face, and pull the sun bonnet she wore
further over her eyes, although in another
couple of days the October moon would
have risen upon the land. She was a
young girl of not more than eighteen or
twenty years, and, as her dress denoted,
bred from the labouring classes. Not
pretty—unless soft brown hair, a fair skin
and delicate features, can make a woman
so—but much more refined in appearance
than the generality of her kind. The
hands that grasped the handle of her heavy
basket had evidently never done much
hard work, nor were her feet broadened or
her back bent with early toiling in the
turnip and the harvest fields. The reason
of this was apparent as soon as she turned
her eyes toward you. Quiet blue eyes
shaded by long lashes, that seldom unveiled
them—eyes that, under more fortuitous
circumstances, might have flashed and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
sparkled with roguish mirth, but that
seemed to bear now a settled melancholy
in them, even when her mouth smiled:
eyes, in fact, that had been blinded from
their birth.</p>

<p>Poor Lizzie Locke! There was a true
and great soul burning in her breast, but
the windows were darkened and it had no
power to look out upon the world. As
she stood still for a few moments’ rest for
the third or fourth time between the salt
marshes and Corston, her quick ear caught
the sound of approaching horses’ feet, and
she drew on one side of the open road to
let the rider pass. But instead of that, the
animal was drawn up suddenly upon its
haunches, and a pleasant young voice rang
out in greeting to her.</p>

<p>‘Why, Lizzie, is that you? What a careless
girl you are—I might have ridden over
you.’</p>

<p>‘Miss Rosa,’ exclaimed the blind girl,
as she recognised the voice and smiled
brightly in return.</p>

<p>‘Of course it’s Miss Rosa, and Polly is
as fresh as a two-year-old this morning.
She always is, when she gets upon the
marshes. It’s lucky I pulled up in time.’</p>

<p>The new comer, a handsome girl of about
the same age as Lizzie, was the only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
daughter of Farmer Murray, of Mavis
Farm. Spoilt, as one girl amongst half-a-dozen
boys is sure to be, it is not to be
wondered at that Rosa Murray was impetuous,
saucy, and self-willed. For, added
to her being her father’s darling, and not
knowing what it was to be denied anything
in his power to give her, Miss Rosa was
extremely pretty, with grey eyes and dark
hair, and a complexion like a crimson rose.
A rich brunette beauty that had gained for
her the title of the Damask Rose of Corston,
and of which no one was better aware than
herself. Many a gentleman visitor at
Rooklands had heard of the fame of the
farmer’s pretty daughter, and ridden over
to Corston on purpose to catch a glimpse
of her, and it was beginning to be whispered
about the village that no one in those parts
would be considered good enough for a
husband for Miss Rosa, and that Mr Murray
was set upon her marrying a gentleman
from London, any gentleman from
‘London’ being considered by the simple
rustics to be unavoidably ‘the glass of
fashion and the mould of form.’ Mr Murray
was termed a ‘gentleman farmer’ in
that part of the county, because he lived in
a substantially-built and well-furnished
house, and could afford to keep riding-horses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
in his stable and sit down to a
dinner spread on a tablecloth every day.
But, in reality, his father had commenced
life as a ploughman in that very village of
Corston, and it was only necessary to bring
Farmer Murray into the presence of Lord
Worcester and his fashionable friends to
see how much of a ‘gentleman’ he was.
He had made the great mistake, however,
of sending his children to be educated at
schools above their station in life, the consequence
of which was that, whilst their
tastes and proclivities remained plebeian as
his own, they had acquired a self-sufficiency
and idea of their merits that accorded ill
with their surroundings and threatened to
mar their future happiness. The Damask
Rose of Corston was the worst example
amongst them of the evil alluded to. She
had unfortunately lost her mother many
years before, so was almost completely
her own mistress, and the admiration her
beauty excited was fast turning her from a
thoughtless flirt into a heartless coquette,
the most odious character any woman can
assume.</p>

<p>But with her own sex, and when it
suited her, Rosa Murray could be agreeable
and ingenuous enough, and there was
nothing but cordiality in the tone in which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
she continued her conversation with Lizzie
Locke.</p>

<p>‘What are you doing out here by yourself,
child? You really ought not to go
about alone. It can’t be safe.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, it’s safe enough, Miss Rosa. I’ve
been used to find my way about ever since
I could walk. I’ve just come up from the
marshes, and I was going to take these
cockles to Mavis Farm to see if the master
would like them for his breakfast to-morrow.’</p>

<p>‘I daresay they will be very glad of
them. George and Bob are awfully fond
of cockles. What a lot you’ve gathered,
Lizzie. How do you manage to find
them, when you can’t see?’</p>

<p>‘I know all the likeliest places they
stick to, Miss Rosa, as well as I do the
chimney corner at home. The tide comes
up and leaves them on the bits of rocks,
and among the boulders, and some spots
are regular beds of them. I’ve been at it
half my life, you see, miss, and I just feel
for them with my fingers and pick them off.
I can tell a piece of samphire, too, by the
sound it makes as I tread over it.’</p>

<p>‘It’s wonderful,’ said Rosa; ‘I have
often been surprised to see you go about
just as though you had the use of your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
eyes. It seems to make no difference to
you.’</p>

<p>Poor Lizzie sighed.</p>

<p>‘Oh, miss! it makes a vast difference—such
a difference as you could never
understand. But I try to make the best
of it, and not be more of a burden upon
aunt and Larry than I need to be.’</p>

<p>‘I’m sure they don’t think you a burden,’
said the other girl, warmly. ‘But I wonder
I didn’t meet you on the marshes just
now. I’ve been galloping all over them.’</p>

<p>‘Not past Corston Point, I hope, miss,’
exclaimed Lizzie, hurriedly.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I have! Why not?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t go there again, Miss Rosa.
It isn’t safe, particularly on horseback.
There’s no end of quagmires beyond the
Point, and you can never tell when you’ll
come on one and be swallowed up, horse
and all.’</p>

<p>Rosa Murray laughed.</p>

<p>‘Why aren’t <i>you</i> swallowed up then,
Lizzie?’</p>

<p>‘I know my way, miss, and I know the
tread of it too. I can tell when the soil
yields more than it should at low tide that
I’m nearing a quicksand. When the Almighty
takes away one sense He sharpens
the others to make up for it. But the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
sands are full of danger; some of them
are shifting too, and you can never tell if
they’re firm to-day whether they won’t be
loose to-morrow. Do take heed, Miss
Rosa, and never you ride beyond Corston
Point without one of the young gentlemen
to take care of you.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I’ll remember your advice, Lizzie,
for I don’t want to be swallowed up alive.
Good-bye.’</p>

<p>She put her horse in motion and cantered
on some little way in advance—then
suddenly checked him again and
turned back. All Rosa Murray’s actions,
like her disposition, were quick and impulsive.</p>

<p>‘By the way, Lizzie, it’s our harvest-home
supper to-night. You must be sure
and make Larry bring you up to the big
barn with him.’</p>

<p>The blind girl crimsoned with pleasure.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Miss Rosa! but what should I be
doing at your supper? I can’t dance,
you know. I shall only be in the way.’</p>

<p>‘Nonsense! You can hear the singing
and the music; we have made papa get a
couple of fiddlers over from Wells; and
you can eat some supper. You will enjoy
yourself, won’t you, Lizzie?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, miss, I think so—that is, if Larry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
and aunt are willing that I should go;
but it’s very good of you to ask me.’</p>

<p>‘You must be sure and come. Tell
Larry I insist upon it. We shall all be
there, you know, and I shall look out for
you, Lizzie, and if I don’t see you I shall
send some one round to your cottage to
fetch you.’</p>

<p>Lizzie Locke smiled and curtsied.</p>

<p>‘I’ll be sure and tell Larry of your goodness,
miss’ she said, ‘and he’ll be able to
thank you better than I can. Here comes
a gentleman,’ she added, as she withdrew
herself modestly from the side of the young
lady’s horse.</p>

<p>The gentleman, whom Lizzie Locke
could have distinguished only as such
from the different sound produced by his
boots in walking, was Lord Worcester’s
head gamekeeper, Frederick Darley. He
was a young fellow to hold the responsible
position he did, being only about thirty
years of age, and he had not held it long;
but he was the son of the gamekeeper on
one of Lord Worcester’s estates in the
south of England, and his lordship had
brought him to Rooklands as soon as
ever a vacancy occurred. He was a
favourite with his master and his master’s
guests, being a man of rather superior<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
breeding and education, but on that very
account he was much disliked by all the
poor people around. Gamekeepers are
not usually popular in a poaching district,
but it was not Frederick Darley’s position
alone that made him a subject for criticism.
His crying sin, to use their own term, was
that he ‘held his head too high.’ The
velveteen coat he usually wore, with a rose
in the button-hole, his curly black hair
and waxed moustache, no less than the
cigars he smoked and the air with which
he affected the society of the gentry,
showed the tenants of Rooklands that he
considered himself vastly above themselves
in position, and they hated him accordingly.
The animus had spread to Corston, but
Mr Darley was not well enough known
there yet to have become a subject for
general comment. Lizzie Locke had
never even encountered him before.</p>

<p>He was walking from the village on the
present occasion swinging a light cane in
his hand, and as Rosa Murray looked up
at the blind girl’s exclamation, she perceived
him close to her horse’s head.</p>

<p>‘Good morning, Miss Murray,’ he said,
lifting his hat.</p>

<p>‘Good morning,’ she replied, without
mentioning any name, but Lizzie Locke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
could detect from the slight tremor in her
voice that she was confused at the sudden
encounter. ‘Were you going down to the
beach?’</p>

<p>‘I was going nowhere but in search of
you.’</p>

<p>‘Shall we walk towards home then?’
said Rosa, suiting the action to the word.
She evidently did not wish the blind girl
to be a party to their conversation. She
called out ‘Good-bye, Lizzie,’ once more
as she walked her horse away, but before
she was out of hearing, the little cockle-gatherer
could distinguish her say to the
stranger in a fluttered voice,—</p>

<p>‘I am so glad you are coming over to
our harvest-home to-night.’</p>

<p>‘One of the grand gentlemen over from
Rooklands come to court Miss Rosa,’ she
thought in the innocence of her heart, as
she turned off the road to take a short
cut across the country to Mavis Farm.
Meanwhile the couple she alluded to
were making their way slowly towards
Corston; she, reining in her horse to the
pace of a tortoise, whilst he walked by the
side with his hand upon the crutch of her
saddle.</p>

<p>‘Could you doubt for a moment whether
I should come?’ said Frederick Darley in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
answer to Rosa’s question. ‘Wouldn’t I
go twenty—fifty miles, for the pleasure of
a dance with you?’</p>

<p>‘You’re such an awful flatterer,’ she
replied, bridling under the compliment;
‘but don’t make too sure of a dance with
me, for papa and my brothers will be
there, and they are so horribly particular
about me.’</p>

<p>‘And not particularly fond of me—I
know it, Miss Murray—but I care nothing
at all about it so long as—as—’</p>

<p>‘As what?’</p>

<p>‘<i>As you are.</i>’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Mr Darley! how can you talk such
nonsense?’</p>

<p>‘It’s not nonsense! it’s sober sense—come,
Rosa, tell me the truth. Are you
playing with me, or not?’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean by “playing”?’</p>

<p>‘You know. Are you in earnest or in
jest? In fact—do you love me better
than you love your father and your
brothers?’</p>

<p>‘Mr Darley! You know I do!’</p>

<p>‘Prove it then, by meeting me to-night.’</p>

<p>‘Meeting you? Are you not coming to
the harvest-home?’</p>

<p>‘I may look in, but I shall not remain
long; I shall only use it as an excuse to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
come over to Corston. Mr Murray is
suspicious of me—I can see that—and
your brothers dislike me. I don’t care to
sit at the table of men who are not my
friends, Rosa. But if you will take an
opportunity to slip out of the barn and
join me in the apple copse, I will wait there
for you at ten o’clock.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! Frederick—if papa should catch
me!’</p>

<p>‘I will take care of that! Only say
you’ll come.’</p>

<p>‘I should like to come—it will be so
lovely and romantic. Just like a scene
in a novel. But I am afraid it is very
wrong.’</p>

<p>‘What is there wrong in a moonlight
stroll? “The summer nights were made
for love,” Rosa, and we shall have a
glorious moon by nine o’clock to-night.
You won’t disappoint me, will you?’</p>

<p>‘No, indeed I won’t; but if anything
should be discovered you will promise
me—’</p>

<p>‘What? I will promise you anything
in the world.’</p>

<p>‘Only that you will shield me from
papa’s anger—that you will say it was all
your fault. For papa is dreadful when he
gets in a temper.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>‘If you should be discovered—which is
not at all likely—I promise you that, rather
than give you back into papa’s clutches, I
will carry you straight off to Rooklands
and marry you with a special licence.
Will that satisfy you? Would you consent
to be my wife, Rosa?’</p>

<p>‘Yes!’ she replied, and earnestly, for
she had been captivated by the manner
and appearance of Frederick Darley for
some weeks past, and this was not the first
meeting by many that they had held without
the knowledge of her father.</p>

<p>‘That’s my own Damask Rose,’ he exclaimed
triumphantly; ‘give me a kiss,
dear, just one to seal the contract; there’s
no one looking!’ He held up his face
towards her as he spoke—his handsome
<i>insouciant</i> face with its bright eyes and
smile, and she stooped hers to meet it, and
give the embrace he petitioned for.</p>

<p>But someone <i>was</i> looking. Almost as
Rosa’s lips met Darley’s a frightened look
came into her eyes, and she uttered a note
of alarm.</p>

<p>‘What is it, darling?’</p>

<p>‘It’s my brother George! He’s coming
this way. Oh! go, Mr Darley—pray go
across the field and let me canter on to
meet him.’ He would have stayed to remonstrate,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
but the girl pushed him from
her, and thinking discretion the better part
of valour, he jumped over a neighbouring
stile and walked away in the direction she
had indicated, whilst she, with a considerable
degree of agitation, rode on to
make what excuses she best could for the
encounter to her brother. George Murray
was sauntering along the hedge-row switching
the leaves off the hazel bushes as he
went, and apparently quite unsuspicious
of anything being wrong. But the first
question he addressed to his sister went
straight to the point.</p>

<p>‘Who was that fellow that was talking
to you just now, Rosa?’</p>

<p>She knew it would be of no use trying
to deceive him, so she spoke the
truth.</p>

<p>‘It was Mr Darley!’</p>

<p>‘What’s he doing over here?’</p>

<p>‘How should I know? You’d better
ask him yourself! Am I accountable for
Mr Darley’s actions?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t talk nonsense. You know what
I mean perfectly well. Did he come over
to Rooklands to see you?’</p>

<p>‘To see me—what will you get into
your head next?’</p>

<p>‘Well, you seemed to be hitting it off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
pretty well together. What were you
whispering to him about just now?’</p>

<p>‘I didn’t whisper to him.’</p>

<p>‘You did! I saw you stoop your head
to his ear. Now look here, Rosa! Don’t
you try any of your flirtation games on
with Darley, or I’ll go straight to the
governor and tell him.’</p>

<p>‘And what business is it of yours, pray?’</p>

<p>‘It would be the business of every one
of us. You don’t suppose we’re going to
let you marry a gamekeeper, do you?’</p>

<p>‘Really, George, you’re too absurd.
Cannot a girl stop to speak to a man in
the road without being accused of wanting
to marry him? You will say I want to
marry every clodhopper I may dance with
at the harvest-home to-night next.’</p>

<p>‘That is a very different thing. The
ploughboys are altogether beneath you,
but this Darley is a kind of half-and-half
fellow that might presume to imagine himself
good enough to be a match for you.’</p>

<p>‘Half-and-half indeed!’ exclaimed Rosa,
nettled at the reflection on her lover;
‘and pray, what are <i>we</i> when all’s said and
done? Mr Darley’s connections are as
good as our own, and better, any day.’</p>

<p>‘Halloa! what are you making a row
about? I’ll tell you what, Rosa. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
strikes me very forcibly you want to
“carry on” with Lord Worcester’s keeper,
and you ought to be ashamed of yourself
for thinking of it. You—who have been
educated and brought up in every respect
like a lady—to condescend to flirt with an
upstart like that, <i>a mere servant</i>! Why,
he’s no better than Isaac Barnes, or old
Whisker, or any of the rest of them, only
he’s prig enough to oil his hair, and wear
a button-hole, in order to catch the eye of
such silly noodles like yourself.’</p>

<p>‘You’ve no right to speak to me in this
way, George. You know nothing at all
about the matter.’</p>

<p>‘I know that I found Darley and you
in the lane with your heads very close together,
and that directly he caught sight
of me he made off. That doesn’t look as
if his intentions were honourable, does it?
Now, look you here, Rosa. Is he coming
to the barn to-night?’</p>

<p>‘I believe so!’</p>

<p>‘And who asked him?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ she replied, evasively;
‘papa, perhaps—or very likely Mr Darley
thought he required no invitation to join
a ploughman’s dance and supper.’</p>

<p>‘Well, you’re not to dance with him if
he does come.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>‘I don’t know what right you have to
forbid it.’</p>

<p>‘None at all! but if you won’t give me
the promise I shall go straight to the
governor, and let him know what I saw
to-day. <i>He’s</i> seen something of it himself,
I can tell you, and he told me to put
you on your guard, so you can take your
choice of having his anger or not.’</p>

<p>This statement was not altogether true,
for if Farmer Murray <i>had</i> heard anything
of his daughter’s flirtation with the handsome
gamekeeper, it had been only what
his sons had suggested to him, and he did
not believe their reports. But the boys,
George and Robert, now young men of
three or four-and-twenty, had had more
than one consultation together on the subject,
and quite made up their minds that
their sister must not be allowed to marry
Frederick Darley. For they were quite
alive to the advantages that a good connection
for her might afford to themselves,
and wanted to see her raise the family
instead of lowering it.</p>

<p>Rosa, however, believed her brother’s
word. Dread of her father’s anger actuated
in a great measure this belief, and she began
to fear lest all communication between
Darley and herself might be broken off if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
she did not give the required promise.
And the very existence of the fear opened
her eyes to the truth, that her lover was
become a necessary part of life’s enjoyment
to her. So, like a true woman
and a hunted hare, she temporised and
‘doubled.’</p>

<p>‘Does papa really think I am too intimate
with Mr Darley, George?’ she
inquired, trembling.</p>

<p>‘Of course he does, like all the rest of
us.’</p>

<p>‘But it’s a mistake. I don’t care a pin
about him.’</p>

<p>‘Then it will be no privation for you
to give up dancing with him to-night.’</p>

<p>‘I never intended to dance with him.’</p>

<p>‘Honour bright, Rosa?’</p>

<p>‘Well, I can’t say more than I have.
However, you will see. I <i>shall not</i> dance
with him. If he asks me, I shall say I am
engaged to you.’</p>

<p>‘You can say what you like, so long as
you snub the brute. I wonder at his impudence
coming up to our “Home” at
all. But these snobs are never wanting in
“cheek.” However, if Bob and I don’t
give him a pretty broad hint to-night that
his room is preferable to his company,
I’m a duffer! Are you going in, Rosa?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>For the young people had continued to
walk towards their own home, and had
now arrived at the farm gates.</p>

<p>‘Yes. I’ve been in the saddle since ten
o’clock this morning, and have had enough
of it.’</p>

<p>‘Let me take Polly round to the stables
before the governor sees the state you’ve
brought her home in, then,’ said George,
as his sister dismounted and threw him
the reins. He could be good-natured
enough when he had his own way, and
he thought he had got it now with Rosa.
But she went up to her chamber bent but
on one idea—how best to let Mr Darley
know of what had passed between her
brother and herself, that he might not be
surprised at the caution of her behaviour
when they met in the big barn.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Meanwhile Lizzie Locke having left
her basket of cockles at Mavis Farm, had
reached her cottage home. Her thoughts
had been very pleasant as she journeyed
there and pondered on the coming pleasure
of the evening. It was not often the poor
child took any part in the few enjoyments
to be met in Corston. People were apt to
leave her out of their invitations, thinking
that as she was blind she could not possibly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
derive any amusement from hearing,
and she was of too shrinking and modest
a nature to obtrude herself where she was
not specially required. She had never
been to one of the harvest-home suppers
given by Farmer Murray (in whose employ
her cousin Laurence worked), though she
had heard much of their delights. But now
that Miss Rosa had particularly desired her
to come, she thought Larry would be pleased
to take her. And she had a print dress
nice and clean for the occasion, and her
aunt would plait her hair neatly for her,
and she should hear the sound of Larry’s
voice as he talked to his companions, and
of his feet whilst he was dancing, and,
perhaps, after supper one of his famous
old English songs—songs which they had
heard so seldom of late, and the music of
which her aunt and she had missed so
much.</p>

<p>It was past twelve o’clock as she entered
the cottage, but she was so full of her grand
news that she scarcely remembered that she
must have kept both her relations waiting
for their dinner of bacon and beans.</p>

<p>‘Why, Lizzie, my girl, where on earth
have you been to?’ exclaimed her aunt,
Mrs Barnes, as she appeared on the threshold.
Mrs Barnes’ late husband had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
brother to the very Isaac Barnes, once
poacher, now gamekeeper on Farmer Murray’s
estate, and there were scandal-mongers
in Corston ill-natured enough to assert that
the taint was in the blood, and that young
Laurence Barnes was very much inclined
to go the same way as his uncle had done
before him. But at present he was a helper
in the stables of Mavis Farm.</p>

<p>‘I’ve been along the marshes,’ said
Lizzie, ‘gathering cockles, and they gave
me sixpence for them up at the farm; and
oh, aunt! I met Miss Rosa on my way
back, and she says Larry must take me up
to the big barn this evening to their harvest-home
supper.’</p>

<p>Laurence Barnes was seated at his
mother’s table already occupied in the discussion
of a huge lump of bread and bacon,
but as the name of his master’s daughter
left Lizzie’s lips it would have been very
evident to any one on the look-out for it
that he started and seemed uneasy.</p>

<p>‘And what will you be doing at a dance
and a supper, my poor girl?’ said her aunt,
but not unkindly. ‘Come, Lizzie, sit down
and take your dinner; that’s of much more
account to you than a harvest merry-making.’</p>

<p>‘Not till Larry has promised to take me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
up with him this evening,’ replied the girl
gaily, and without the least fear of a rebuff.
‘You’ll do it, Larry, won’t you? for Miss
Rosa said they’d all be there, and if she
didn’t see me she’d send round to the
cottage after me. She said, “Tell Larry I
<i>insist</i> upon it; she did, indeed!”’</p>

<p>‘Well, then, I’m not going up myself,
and so you can’t go,’ he answered roughly.</p>

<p>‘<i>Not going yourself!</i>’</p>

<p>The exclamation left the lips of both
women at once. They could not understand
it, and it equally surprised them.
Larry—the best singer and dancer for
twenty miles round, to refuse to go up to
his master’s harvest-home! Why, what
would the supper and the dance be without
him? At least, so thought Mrs Barnes
and Lizzie.</p>

<p>‘Aren’t you well, Larry?’ demanded
the blind girl, timidly.</p>

<p>‘I’m well enough; but I don’t choose to
go. I don’t care for such rubbish. Let ’em
bide! They’ll do well enough without us.’</p>

<p>Lizzie dropt into her seat in silence, and
began in a mechanical way to eat her
dinner. She was terribly disappointed,
but she did not dream of disputing her
cousin’s decision. He was master in that
house; and she would not have cared to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
go to the barn without Larry. Half the
pleasure would be gone with his absence.
He did not seem to see that.</p>

<p>‘Mother can take you up, Liz, if she has
a mind to,’ he said, presently.</p>

<p>‘<i>I</i> take her along of me!’ cried Mrs
Barnes, ‘when I haven’t so much as a clean
kerchief to pin across my shoulders. You’re
daft, Larry. I haven’t been to such a thing
as a dance since I laid your father in the
churchyard, and if our Liz can’t go without
me she must stop at home.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t want to go, indeed I don’t, not
without Larry,’ replied the blind girl,
earnestly.</p>

<p>‘And what more did Miss Rosa say to
you?’ demanded her aunt, inquisitively.</p>

<p>‘We talked about the sands, aunt. She’d
been galloping all over them this morning,
and I told her how dangerous they were
beyond Corston Point, and we was getting
on so nice together, when some one came
and interrupted us.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Some one!</i> Who’s some one?’ said
Laurence Barnes, quickly.</p>

<p>‘I can’t tell you; I never met him
before.’</p>

<p>‘’Twas a man, then?’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes! ’twas a man—a gentleman!
I knew that, because there were no nails<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
in his boots, and he didn’t give at the knees
as he walked.’</p>

<p>‘What more?’ demanded Larry, with
lowered brows.</p>

<p>‘Miss Rosa knew him well, because they
never named each other, but only wished
“good morning.” She said, “What are you
doing here?” and he said, “Looking after
you.” He carried a rose in his hand or
his coat, I think, for I smelt it, and a cane,
too, for it struck the saddle flap.’</p>

<p>‘Well, that’s enough,’ interrupted Laurence,
fiercely.</p>

<p>‘I thought you wanted to hear all about
it, Larry?’</p>

<p>‘Is there any more to tell, then?’</p>

<p>‘Only that as they walked away together,
Miss Rosa said she was so glad he was
coming up to the harvest-home to-night.’</p>

<p>‘So <i>he’s</i> a-going, the cur!’ muttered the
young man between his teeth. ‘<i>I</i> know
him, with his cane, and his swagger, and
his stinking roses; and I’ll be even with
him yet, or my name’s not Larry Barnes.’</p>

<p>It was evident that Mr Frederick Darley
was no greater favourite in the cottage
than the farm.</p>

<p>‘Whoever are you talking of?’ said
Larry’s mother. ‘Do you know the gentleman
Lizzie met with Miss Rosa?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>‘<i>Gentleman!</i> He’s no gentleman. He’s
nothing but a common gamekeeper, same
as uncle. But don’t let us talk of him any
more. It takes the flavour of the bacon
clean out of my mouth.’</p>

<p>The rest of the simple meal was performed
in silence, and then Mrs Barnes
gathered up the crockery and carried it
into an outer room to wash.</p>

<p>Larry and Lizzie were left alone. The
girl seemed to understand that in some
mysterious way she had offended her
cousin, and wished to restore peace between
them, so she crept up to where he
was smoking his midday pipe on the old
settle by the fire, and laid her head gently
against his knees. They had been brought
up from babes together, and were used to
observe such innocent little familiarities
towards each other.</p>

<p>‘Never mind about the outing, Larry.
I’m not a bit disappointed, and I’m sorry I
said anything about it.’</p>

<p>‘That’s not true, Liz. You <i>are</i> disappointed,
and it’s my doing; but I couldn’t
help it. I didn’t feel somehow as if I had
the heart to go. But I’ve changed my
mind since dinner, and we’ll go up to the
harvest-home together, my girl. Will
that content you?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, Larry! you <i>are</i> good!’ she said,
raising herself, her cheeks crimsoned with
renewed expectation; ‘but I’d rather stop
at home a thousand times over than you
should put yourself out of the way for
me.’</p>

<p>A sudden thought seemed to strike the
young man as he looked at Lizzie’s fair,
sightless face. He had lived with her so
long, in a sisterly way, that it had never
struck him to regard her in any other light.
But something in the inflection of her voice
as she addressed him, made him wonder if
he were capable of making her happier
than she had ever been yet. He cherished
no other hopes capable of realisation.
What if he could make his own troubles
lighter by lightening those of poor Liz?
Something of this sort, but in much rougher
clothing, passed through his half-tutored
mind. As it grasped the idea he turned
hurriedly towards the girl kneeling at his
knee.</p>

<p>‘Do you really care about me, lass?’ he
said. ‘Do you care if I’m vexed or not?
Whether I come in or go out? If I like
my dinner or I don’t like it? Does all
this nonsense worry you? Answer me,
for I want to know.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! Larry, what do you mean? Of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
course I care. I can’t do much for you—more’s
the pity—without my poor eyes,
but I can think of you and love you,
Larry, and surely you know that I do
both.’</p>

<p>‘But would you like to love me more,
Liz?’</p>

<p>‘How could I love you more?’</p>

<p>‘Would you like to have the <i>right</i> to
care for me—the <i>right</i> to creep after me in
your quiet way wherever I might happen
to go—the <i>right</i> to walk alongside of me,
with your hand in mine, up to the harvesting
home to-night; eh, Liz?’</p>

<p>The girl half understood her cousin’s
meaning, but she was too modest not to
fear she might be mistaken. Larry could
never wish to take <i>her</i>, blind and helpless,
for his <i>wife</i>.</p>

<p>‘Larry, speak to me more plainly; I
don’t catch your meaning quite.’</p>

<p>‘Will you marry me then, Liz, and live
along of mother and me to the end of your
life?’</p>

<p>‘<i>Marry you!</i>—Be your <i>wife</i>!—<i>Me!</i>
<i>Oh</i>, Larry, you can’t mean it! never.’</p>

<p>‘I do mean it,’ replied her cousin with
an oath; ‘and I’ll take you as soon as ever
you’ll take me if you will but say the
word.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>‘But I am <i>blind</i>, Larry.’</p>

<p>‘Do you suppose I don’t know that?
Perhaps I likes you blind best.’</p>

<p>‘But I am so useless. I get about so
slowly. If anything was to happen to
aunt, how could I keep the house clean
and cook the dinners, Larry? You must
think a bit more before you decide for good.’</p>

<p>But the poor child’s face was burning
with excitement the while, and her sightless
eyes were thrown upwards to her
cousin’s face as though she would strain
through the darkness to see it.</p>

<p>‘If anything happened to mother, do
you suppose I’d turn you out of doors, Liz?
And in any case, then, I must have a wife
or a servant to do the work—it will make
no difference that way. The only question
is, do you want me for a husband?’</p>

<p>‘Oh! I have loved you ever so!’ replied
the girl, throwing herself into his arms.
‘I couldn’t love another man, Larry. I
know your face as well as if I had seen it,
and your step, and your voice. I can tell
them long before another body knows
there’s sound a-coming.’</p>

<p>‘Then you’ll have me?’</p>

<p>‘If you’ll have <i>me</i>,’ she murmured in a
tone of delight as she nestled against his
rough clothes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>‘That’s settled, then, and the sooner the
banns are up the better! Here, mother!
Come along and hear the news. Lizzie
has promised to marry me, and I shall
take her to church as soon as we’ve been
cried.’</p>

<p>‘Well! I <i>am</i> pleased,’ said Mrs Barnes.
‘You couldn’t have got a neater wife,
Larry, though her eyesight’s terribly against
her, poor thing! But I’m sure of one
thing, Liz, if you can’t do all for him that
another woman might, you’ll love my lad
with the best among them, and that thought
will make me lie quiet in my grave.’</p>

<p>The poor cannot afford the time to be
as sentimental over such things as the rich.
Larry kissed his cousin two or three times
on the forehead in signification of the compact
they had just entered into, and then
he got up and shook himself, and prepared
to go back to his afternoon work.</p>

<p>‘That’s a good job settled,’ he thought
as he did so; ‘it will make Lizzie happy,
and drive a deal of nonsense may be out of
my head. But if ever I can pay out that
scoundrel Darley I’ll do it, if it costs me
the last drop of my blood.’</p>

<p>The blind girl regarded what had passed
between her cousin and herself with very
different feelings. Condemned, by reason<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
of her infirmity, to pass much of her young
life in solitude, the privation had repaid itself
by giving her the time and opportunity
for an amount of self-culture which,
if subjected to the rough toil and rougher
pleasures of her class, she never could have
attained. Her ideas regarding the sanctity
of love and marriage were very different
from those of other Corston girls. She
could never have ‘kept company,’ as they
termed it, with one man this month and
another the next. Her pure mind, which
dwelt so much within itself, shrank from
the levity and coarseness with which she
had heard such subjects treated, and believing,
as she had done, that she should never
be married, she had pleased herself by
building up an ideal of what a husband
should be, and how his wife would love
and reverence him. And this ideal had
always had for its framework a fancied
portrait of her cousin Laurence. In reality,
this young fellow was an average specimen
of a fresh-faced country youth, with plenty
of colour and flesh and muscle. But to
the blind girl’s fancy he was perfection.
Her little hands from babyhood had traced
each feature of his face until she knew
every line by heart, and though she had
never acknowledged it even to herself, she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
had been in love with him ever since she
was capable of understanding the meaning
of the term. So that although his proposal
to marry her had come as a great
surprise, it had also come as a great glory,
and set her heart throbbing with the pleasant
consciousness of returned affection.</p>

<p>She was in a flutter of triumph and
delight all the afternoon, whilst Larry was
attending to his horses, and hardly knew
how to believe in her own happiness.
Her aunt brushed and plaited her long hair
for her till it was as glossy and neat as
possible, and tied her new cherry-coloured
ribbon round the girl’s throat that she
might not disgrace her son’s choice at the
merry-making. And then Lizzie sat down
to wait for her affianced lover’s return, the
proudest maid in Corston. Larry came in
punctually for his tea, and the first thing
he did was to notice the improvement in
his little cousin’s appearance; and indeed
joy had so beautified her countenance that
she was a different creature from what she
had been on the sands that morning. The
apathy and indifference to life had disappeared,
and a bright colour bloomed in her
soft cheeks. As she tucked her hand
through her cousin’s arm, and they set off
to walk together to Farmer Murray’s harvest-home,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
Mrs Barnes looked after them
with pride, and declared that if poor Liz
had only got her sight they would have
made the handsomest couple in the parish.</p>

<p>Larry was rather silent as they went up
to the barn together, but Liz was not
<i>exigeante</i>, and trotted by his side with an
air of perfect content. When they arrived
they found the place already full, but the
‘quality’ had not yet arrived, and until
they did so, no one ventured to do more
than converse quietly with his neighbour,
although the fiddlers from Wells were all
ready and only waiting a signal to strike
up. But in those days the working men
did not consider their festival complete
without the presence of the master, and
it would have been a sore affront if the
members and guests of the household had
not also joined them in order to open the
ball and set the liquor flowing. In these
days of Radicalism perhaps they find they
can get on just as well without them.
Larry still kept Lizzie’s arm snugly tucked
within his own as he described to her how
beautiful the walls of the barn looked
hung with flags and decorated with flowers
and evergreens, and what a number of
lamps there were, and what a lot of liquor
and eatables were stowed away at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
further end. He was still talking to her
rapidly, and, as she imagined, somewhat
uneasily, when a cheer rose up from a
group of rustics outside, and Larry gave
a start that almost disengaged her from
his clasp.</p>

<p>‘What’s the matter?’ she demanded.
‘Is it the gentry coming, Larry?’</p>

<p>‘Yes! ’tis they, sure enough. Keep
close to me, Liz—I don’t want to part
from you, not for one moment.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Larry! that do make me feel so
happy,’ she whispered. As she spoke, the
party from Mavis Farm entered the barn
and were received with a shout of welcome.
Mr Murray, a fine, hale old gentleman,
and his sons came first; then Miss Rosa,
looking rather conscious, tripping after her
brothers in a white muslin dress. The
farmer advanced to the beer barrel, and
having filled his glass, drank success to
all present, and asked them to give three
cheers for a bountiful harvest. When
that ceremony was completed the fiddlers
struck up a merry country dance, and
every one was at liberty to drink and caper
about. The young people from Mavis
Farm all took part in the first dance, and
Rosa Murray came up and asked Larry
if he would be her partner on the occasion.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
She ought in fairness to have opened the
ball with her father’s bailiff or one of the
upper servants, but she preferred the
young groom, with whom she held daily
intercourse, and she was accustomed to go
her own way without reference to anybody’s
feelings. As she approached the cousins
she gave Lizzie a kindly welcome.</p>

<p>‘I am so glad you have come up, Lizzie;
and now your cousin must get you a nice
seat until this dance is ended, for I intend
him to open the ball with me.’</p>

<p>This was considered a great honour on
the part of the villagers, and the blind girl
coloured with pleasure to think that her
<i>fiancé</i> had been selected for the ceremony.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Miss Rosa, you <i>are</i> good! Larry,
why don’t you thank the young lady, and
say how proud you shall be to dance alongside
of her?’</p>

<p>But Larry said nothing. He reddened,
it is true, but more from confusion than
pleasure, and he was so long a time settling
Lizzie to his satisfaction, that Rosa was
disposed to be angry at his dilatoriness,
and called out to him sharply that if he
were not ready she should open the ball
with some one else. Then he ran and
took his place by her side, and went
through the evolutions of ‘down the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
middle’ and ‘setting at the corners’ with
a burning face and a fast-beating heart.
Poor Laurence Barnes! His young mistress’s
constant presence in the stables and
familiarity with himself had been too much
for his susceptible nature. She was to
him, in the pride of her youthful loveliness
and the passport it afforded her for smiling
upon all classes of men, as an angel, rather
than a woman, something set too high
above for him ever to reach, but yet with
the power to thrill his veins and make his
hot blood run faster. The touch of her
ungloved hand in the figures of the dance
made him tremble, and the glance of her
eyes sickened him, so that as soon as the
terrible ordeal was concluded he made her
an awkward salute, and rushed from her
side to that of the beer barrel, to drown
his excitement in drink. And it was just
there that he had left Lizzie Locke.</p>

<p>‘That was beautiful, Larry,’ she exclaimed,
with glowing cheeks. ‘I could
hear the sound of your feet and Miss
Rosa’s above all the others, even when you
went to the further end of the barn. It
must be lovely to be able to dance like
that. But it has made you thirsty, Larry.
That’s the third glass, isn’t it?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, lass, it’s made me thirsty. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
don’t you keep counting my glasses all the
evening, or I shall move your chair a bit
further off.’</p>

<p>She laughed quietly, and he flung himself
upon the ground and rested his arm
upon her knee. He seemed to feel safer
and more at peace when by Lizzie’s side,
and she was quite happy in the knowledge
that he was there. The Mavis Farm party
did not dance again after the ball had
been opened, at least Miss Rosa did not.
But she moved about the barn restlessly.
Sometimes she was in, and sometimes she
was out. She did not seem to know her
own mind for two minutes together.</p>

<p>‘Why is that fellow Darley skulking
about here, Larry?’ demanded Isaac Barnes
of his nephew. ‘I’ve seen his ugly face
peeping into the barn a dozen times. Why
don’t he come in or stay out? I hate
such half-and-half sneaking ways.’</p>

<p>Larry muttered an oath, and was about
to make some reply, when George Murray
came up to them.</p>

<p>‘Is that Mr Darley I see hanging about
the barn door, Isaac?’ he inquired of their
own keeper.</p>

<p>‘That it be, Master George; and as
I was just saying to Larry here, why
not in or out? What need of dodging?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
He don’t want to catch no one here, I
suppose?’</p>

<p>‘He’d better try. I’d soon teach him
who the barn belongs to.’</p>

<p>‘And I’d back you, Master George,’
cried Larry resolutely. The strong-brewed
Norfolk ale was giving him a dash of
Dutch courage.</p>

<p>‘Would you, Larry? That’s right!
Well, I can’t be in all parts of the barn
at once, and father wants me to take the
bottom of the supper-table, so you keep
your eye on Mr Darley for me, will you?
and if he looks up to anything, let me
know.’</p>

<p>‘I’m your man, Master George,’ replied
Larry heartily.</p>

<p>Rosa was near enough to them to overhear
what had passed. Her brother had
intended she should do so. But when he
set his wit against that of a woman he
reckoned without his host. Rosa had
been on the look-out for Frederick Darley
from the beginning of the evening, and
during the first greeting, had managed to
slip a little note into his hand, warning
him of her brother’s animosity, and begging
him to keep as much as possible out of
their sight until an opportunity occurred
for her joining him in the apple copse.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
Now, she felt afraid of what might happen
if there were an encounter between the
two young men, and decided at once that
her best plan would be, as soon as she
saw George safely disposed of at the
supper-table, to tamper with his spy. And
unfortunately Rosa Murray knew but too
well how to accomplish this. Young
Barnes’ infatuation had not been unnoticed
by her. She would have been aware of
it if a cat had admired her. She knew
his hand trembled when he took her foot
to place her in the saddle, and that he
became so nervous and agitated when she
entered the stable as often to have to be
recalled to a sense of his duty by a sharp
rebuke from the head groom. She had
known it all for months past, and it had
pleased her. She was so vain and heartless
that she thought nothing of what pain
the poor fellow might be undergoing. She
laughed at his presumption, and only considered
it another feather in her cap. But
now she saw her way to make use of it.
The dancing had recommenced, and was
proceeding with vigour, and the huge
rounds of beef and legs of mutton on the
supper-table were beginning to be served
out. George was in full action, leading
the onslaught with his carving-knife,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
when Rosa Murray approached Laurence
Barnes.</p>

<p>‘Won’t you dance again, nor go and
have your supper, Larry dear?’ Lizzie
was asking, with a soft caress of her hand
upon the head laid on her knee.</p>

<p>‘I don’t want to dance no more,’ said
Larry, ‘and I sha’n’t sup till the table’s
clearer and you can sup with me, Liz.’</p>

<p>‘That’s very good of you, Barnes,’ said
Rosa, who had caught the words; ‘but
if you’ll take Lizzie to the table now, I’m
sure George will find room for you both.’</p>

<p>‘No thank you, miss,’ he answered; ‘I
promised Master George to bide here till
he came back, and I mustn’t break my
word.’</p>

<p>‘Then I shall sit here with you, and
we’ll all have supper together by-and-by,’
replied Rosa. ‘Have you been gathering
cockles again this afternoon, Lizzie?’</p>

<p>‘Oh no, miss!’ said Lizzie, blushing at
the recollection of how her afternoon had
been employed; ‘it’s high tide at four
o’clock now, and I haven’t been out of
the house again to-day.’</p>

<p>‘Did your cousin tell you how she
scolded me for riding in the salt marshes,
Barnes?’</p>

<p>‘Well! it <i>is</i> dangerous, miss, for such as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
don’t know the place. I mind me when
Whisker’s grandfather strayed out there by
himself—’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Larry!’ cried Lizzie, ‘don’t go to
tell that terrible tale. It always turns me
sick!’</p>

<p>‘Is that what they call the Marsh Ghost,
Barnes? Oh! I must know all about it.
I love ghost stories, and I have never been
able to hear the whole of this one. Where
does it appear, and when?’</p>

<p>‘Lizzie here can tell you better than me,
miss—she knows the story right through.’</p>

<p>‘It’s a horrible tale, Miss Rosa. You’ll
never forget it, once heard.’</p>

<p>‘That’s just why I want to hear it; so,
Lizzie, you must tell it me directly. Don’t
move, Barnes, you don’t inconvenience me.
I can sit up in this corner quite well.’</p>

<p>‘Well, miss, if you <i>must</i> hear it,’ began
the blind girl, ‘it happened now nigh upon
twenty years ago. Whisker’s grandfather,
that used to keep the lodge at Rooklands,
had grown so old and feeble the late lord
pensioned him off and sent him home to
his own people. He hadn’t no son in
Corston then, miss, because they was both
working in the south, but his daughter-in-law,
his first son’s widdy, that had married
Skewton the baker, she offered to take the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
old man in and do for him. Lord
Worcester allowed him fifty pounds a-year
for life, and Mrs Skewton wanted to take
it all for his keep, but the old man was too
sharp for that, and he only gave her ten
shillings a-week and put by the rest, no one
knew where nor for what. Well, miss, this
went on for three or four years may be, and
then poor Whisker had grown very feeble
and was a deal of trouble, and his sons
didn’t seem to be coming back, and the
Skewtons had grown tired of him, so they
neglected him shamefully. I shouldn’t like
to tell you, miss, all that’s said of their
beating the poor old man and starving him,
and never giving him no comforts. At
last he got quite silly and took to wandering
about alone, and he used to go out on
the marshes, high or low tide, without any
sense of the danger, and everybody said
he’d come to harm some day. And so he
did, for one day they carried his body in
from Corston Point quite dead, and all
bruised with the rocks and stones. The
Skewtons pretended as they knew nothing
about how he’d come to his death, but they
set up a cart just afterwards, and nothing
has ever been heard of the old man’s store
of money, though his sons came back and
inquired and searched far and near for it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
But about six months after—Larry! ’tisn’t
a fit tale for Miss Rosa to listen to!’</p>

<p>‘Nonsense, Lizzie! I wouldn’t have the
ghost left out for anything. It’s just that
I want to hear of.’</p>

<p>‘Well, miss, as I said, six months after
old Whisker’s death he began to walk again,
and he’s walked ever since.’</p>

<p>‘Where does he walk?’</p>

<p>‘Round and round Corston Point every
full moon, wringing his hands and asking
for his money. They say it’s terrible to
see him.’</p>

<p>‘Have you ever seen him, Barnes?’</p>

<p>Larry coloured deeply and shook his
head. The peasantry all over England are
very susceptible to superstition, and the
Corston folk were not behindhand in their
fear of ghosts, hobgoblins, and apparitions
of all sorts. This young fellow would have
stood up in a fight with the best man there,
but the idea of seeing a ghost made his
blood curdle.</p>

<p>‘Dear me, miss, no,’ said Lizzie, answering
for him, ‘and I hope he never may.
Why, it would kill him.’</p>

<p>‘Nonsense, Lizzie. Barnes is not such
a coward, I hope.’</p>

<p>Something in Miss Murray’s tone made
the blood leap to her retainer’s face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>‘I’m not a coward, miss,’ he answered
quickly.</p>

<p>‘Of course not; I said so. But any man
would be so who refused to go to Corston
Point by night for fear of seeing old
Whisker’s ghost. He walks at full moon,
you say! Why, he must be at it to-night,
then! There never was a lovelier moon.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t, miss,’ urged Lizzie, shivering.</p>

<p>‘You silly goose! I don’t want you to
go. But, I must say, I should like to try
the mettle of our friend here.’</p>

<p>‘I beg your pardon, miss; did you mean
that for me?’ said Larry quickly.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I did, Barnes. What harm? I
should like to see some one who had really
seen this ghost, and I’ll give my gold watch
chain to the man who will go to Corston
Point to-night and bring me a bunch
of the samphire that grows upon the top
of it.’</p>

<p>Larry’s mind was in a tumult. Some
wild idea of rendering himself admirable in
Rosa Murray’s eyes may have influenced
his decision—or the delight of possessing
her watch chain may have urged him on to
it. Anyway, he rose up from the floor, and
with chattering teeth, but a resolute heart,
exclaimed,—</p>

<p>‘I’ll take you at your word, miss. I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
go to Corston Point and bring you the
samphire, and prove to you that Larry
Barnes is not a coward.’</p>

<p>‘Larry, Larry, you’ll never do it!’ cried
Lizzie.</p>

<p>‘Let me alone, my girl. I’ve made up
my mind, and you won’t turn it.’</p>

<p>‘You <i>are</i> a brave fellow, Barnes,’ said
Rosa. ‘I believe you’re the only man in
Corston that would have taken my wager.
And, mind, it’s a bargain. My gold watch
chain for your bunch of samphire and news
of old Whisker’s ghost.’ She was delighted
at the idea of getting him out of
the way.</p>

<p>‘But, Larry! Miss Rosa! Think of
the danger,’ implored poor Lizzie. ‘Oh,
he’ll never come back; I know he’ll never
come back.’</p>

<p>‘What are you afraid of, Lizzie? Doesn’t
Barnes know the sands as well as you do?
And the moonlight is as bright as day.
It’s silly to try and stop him.’</p>

<p>‘But he’s going to be my husband, miss,’
whispered Lizzie, weeping, into Miss
Murray’s ear.</p>

<p>‘Oh! if that’s the case, perhaps he’d
better follow your wishes,’ rejoined Rosa
coldly. ‘Mine are of no consequence, of
course, though I’d have liked Barnes to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
wear my chain—we’ve been such good
company together, haven’t we, Larry?’</p>

<p>Her smile, and the way in which she
spoke his name, determined him. He had
heard the whispered conversation between
her and Lizzie, and he felt vexed—he
didn’t know why—that it should have
occurred.</p>

<p>‘Be quiet, Liz,’ he said, authoritatively.
‘What’s to be has nothing to do with this.
I’m only too glad to oblige Miss Rosa,
even with a bit of samphire. Good-bye,
my girl, and good-bye, miss; it’s close
upon the stroke of ten, so you mayn’t see
me again till to-morrow morning; but
when you do, it’ll be <i>with the bunch of
samphire in my hand</i>!’</p>

<p>He darted away from them as he spoke,
and left the barn; whilst Lizzie Locke,
disappointed at his departure, and frightened
for his safety, wept bitterly. But the
noise around them was so great, and everyone
was so much occupied with his or her
own pleasure, that little notice was taken
of the girl’s emotion.</p>

<p>‘Come, Lizzie, don’t be foolish,’ urged
Miss Murray, in a whisper, afraid lest the
errand on which she had sent Larry should
become public property. ‘Your lover will
be back in an hour, at the latest.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>‘He’ll never come back, miss! You’ve
sent him to his death; I feel sure of it,’
replied Lizzie, sobbing.</p>

<p>‘This is too ridiculous,’ said Rosa. ‘If
you intend to make such a fool of yourself
as this, Lizzie, I think you had much
better go home to your aunt. Shall I send
Jane Williams back with you? You know
her; she’s a kind girl, and she’ll lead you
as safely as Larry would.’</p>

<p>‘No; thank you, miss; Larry said he
would return to the barn with your samphire,
and I must wait here till he comes—if
ever he comes,’ she added mournfully.</p>

<p>‘Well, you’ve quite upset me with all
this nonsense, and I must have a breath
of fresh air. If Master George, or papa,
should ask for me, Lizzie, say I’ve got a
headache, and gone home for a little while.
I’ll be round again before Larry’s back;
but if anything should keep me, tell him
he shall have the chain to-morrow morning.
For he’s a brave fellow, Lizzie, and
whether he sees the ghost or not, he
shall keep my watch chain as a wedding
present.’</p>

<p>She patted the blind girl’s hand before
she tripped away; but no amount of encouragement
could have driven the conviction
from Lizzie Locke’s breast that her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
lover was a doomed man; and added to
this, she had an uncomfortable feeling in
her heart (though too undefined to be
called jealousy), that his alacrity in complying
with his young mistress’s request arose
from something more than a desire to
maintain his character for courage in her
eyes. So the poor child sat by the beer
barrel, sad and silent, with her face buried
in her hands; and so she remained till
midnight had sounded from the church
clock, and the lights were put out, and the
festivities concluded, and some kind neighbour
led her back to her aunt’s house.
But neither Miss Rosa nor Larry had
returned.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Miss Rosa’s ‘breath of fresh air’ meant,
of course, her appointment with Frederick
Darley in the apple copse. She had got
Larry nicely out of the way (notwithstanding
the fears of his betrothed), and there
was no obstacle in her path as she left the
barn and approached the place of meeting.
She had taken the precaution to wrap a
large dark shawl round her white dress,
and, thus concealed, crept softly down the
lane and through the lower meadow unobservant
or unheeding that her father’s
terrier, Trim, had followed her footsteps.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
Mr Darley was in waiting for her, and a
lover-like colloquy ensued. He did not
again mention the subject of marriage, at
which Rosa was somewhat disappointed;
for she believed that, notwithstanding her
brother’s assertions to the contrary, Mr
Murray might not refuse his consent to her
becoming Frederick Darley’s wife; and he
certainly was the handsomest man round
about, Lord Worcester himself not excepted.
But in the midst of their tender conversation,
as Darley was telling Rosa he loved her
better than ever man had loved woman in
this world before, Trim commenced wagging
his tail and snuffing the grass.</p>

<p>‘What is the matter?’ cried Rosa in
alarm. ‘Down, Trim, down—be quiet,
sir! Oh, Frederick! surely no one can be
coming this way.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be afraid,’ said her companion;
‘throw your shawl over your head and
trust to me. I will answer for it that no
one shall molest you whilst under my
protection.’</p>

<p>But he had not calculated upon having
to make his words good in the presence of
her father and brother.</p>

<p>Trim would <i>not</i> lie down, nor be quiet,
but kept on with his little signals of warning,
until two dark figures could be discerned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
making their way towards them
over the grass, when he bounded away to
meet them. Rosa guessed who the newcomers
must be, and her heart died within
her for fear. She would have screamed,
but Darley placed his hand before her
mouth. There was no escape for the
lovers, even if an attempt to escape would
not have increased suspicion, for the apple
copse was a three-cornered field that had
but the one entrance through which they
had come. In another moment the four
had met, and Rosa recognised her father
and her brother George. How they had
guessed they would find her there she did
not stay to ask or even think. All her
thought was how to shield herself from the
farmer’s anger. The fact was that George
had wished to seat his sister at the supper-table,
when, finding that she and Darley
and Larry had all three mysteriously disappeared,
he had communicated his suspicions
and the events of the morning to his
father, and they had sallied forth together
in search of the missing daughter, and were
on their way to the farm, where they had
been told she had gone, when Trim’s unwarrantable
interference led them to the
very spot.</p>

<p>Mr Murray’s rage was unbounded. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
did not wait for any explanations, but
walked up straight to Rosa and demanded,—</p>

<p>‘Is this my daughter?’</p>

<p>The girl was too frightened to speak as
she clung to her lover’s arm, but Darley,
perceiving that an amicable settlement was
out of the question, replied in the same
tone,—</p>

<p>‘What right have you to ask, sir?’</p>

<p>‘The right of a father, Mr Darley, who
has no intention to let disgrace be brought
into his family by such as you.’</p>

<p>He pulled Rosa by the arm roughly as
he spoke, and dragged the shawl from her
face.</p>

<p>‘So it is you, you jade; and you would
try and deceive your father, who has never
refused you a thing in his life. That’s the
gratitude of women. However, you’ll pay
for it. You’ve had your first clandestine
meeting and your last. No more gamekeeper’s
courtships for you if I know it.’</p>

<p>‘By what right, Mr Murray, do you
insult me, or this young lady, in my
presence? If I have persuaded her to do
a foolish thing, I am sorry for it, but you
cannot give a harsher name to a lover’s
moonlight walk.’</p>

<p>‘I do give it a harsher name, sir, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
you know it deserves it. A lover’s moonlight
walk indeed! You mean a scoundrel’s
endeavour to get an innocent girl into his
clutches.’</p>

<p>‘Papa! papa! you are quite mistaken.
Mr Darley has asked me to marry him.
He will marry me to-morrow by special
licence if you will only give your consent.’</p>

<p>‘Marry you to-morrow! you poor fool!
You’ve been swallowing every lie he chose
to tell you. He can’t marry you to-morrow
nor any day, and for a good reason. <i>He’s
a married man already.</i>’</p>

<p>Rosa screamed, George uttered an oath,
and Darley darted forward.</p>

<p>‘Who told you so, Mr Murray?’</p>

<p>‘Never mind who told me; you know
it is true. Can you deny that you left a
wife down south when you came to Rooklands?
Lord Worcester does not know it,
perhaps, but there are those who do.’</p>

<p>‘Who is your informant?’ repeated
Darley.</p>

<p>‘I shall not tell you; but if you don’t
clear out of my meadow and Corston within
half-an-hour, and promise never to show
your face here again, I’ll lay the whole
story before his lordship.’</p>

<p>‘Are you going, or shall I kick you out?’
inquired George.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>Frederick Darley thought upon the
whole he’d better go. He turned on his
heel with an oath, and slunk out of the
apple copse like a beaten cur.</p>

<p>‘Come, my girl,’ said Farmer Murray,
not unkindly, as he commenced to walk
homeward, with his hand still on Rosa’s
arm; ‘you’ve been a fool, but I hope
you’ve been nothing worse. Never see
nor speak to the man again, and I’ll
forgive you.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, papa! is it really true?’ she answered,
sobbing.</p>

<p>‘It’s as true as Heaven, Rosa! It was
Larry Barnes told it me a week ago, and
he had it from one of the Whiskers, who
worked near Lord Worcester’s estate in
Devon, and knew Mrs Frederick Darley
by sight. You’ve had a narrow escape,
my girl, and you may thank Larry for
it.’</p>

<p>‘Poor Larry!’ sighed Rosa; and if she
could have known what was happening
to poor Larry at that moment, she would
have sighed still deeper. He had accepted
her wager, and rushed off at her
bidding to get the bunch of samphire that
grew at the top of Corston Point. His
brain was rather staggered at the idea
of what he had undertaken, but he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
been plentifully plied with Farmer Murray’s
“Old October,” and it was a bright,
moonlight night, so that he did not find
the expedition after all so terrible as he
had imagined. The salt marshes were
very lonely, it is true, and more than
once Larry turned his head fearfully over
his shoulder, to find that nothing worse
followed him than his own shadow; but
he reached the Point in safety, and secured
the samphire, without having encountered
old Whisker’s ghost. Then
his spirits rose again, and he whistled as
he commenced to retrace his steps to the
village. He knew he had been longer
over the transaction than he had expected,
and that he should be unable to see
Miss Rosa that night; but he intended to
be up at the farm the very first thing in
the morning, and give the bunch of
samphire into her own hands. He did
not expect to receive the watch chain; he
had not seen the ghost, and had not
earned it; but Larry’s heart was all the
lighter for that. He would not have
exchanged a view of the dreaded spectre
even for the coveted gold chain that had
hung so long round the fair neck of his
divinity. But as he turned Corston Point
again, he started back to see a figure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
before him. The first moment he thought
it must be old Whisker’s ghost, but the
next convinced him of his error. It was
only Mr Darley—Lord Worcester’s gamekeeper!
He had been so absorbed in
angry and remorseful thought since he
left the apple copse that he had unwittingly
taken the wrong turning, and now
found himself upon the wide, desolate
waste of the salt marshes, and rather
uncertain on which side to find the beaten
track again which led to the road to
Rooklands. The two men were equally
surprised and disgusted at encountering
one another.</p>

<p>‘What are you doing here?’ demanded
Darley, insolently.</p>

<p>‘What business is that of yours?’
replied the other. ‘The salt marshes
belong to me, I suppose, as much as they
do to you.’</p>

<p>‘You’re not likely to have business here
at this time of night. You’ve been
dogging my footsteps,’ said Darley, without
the least consideration for probability.</p>

<p>‘Follow <i>you</i>!’ exclaimed Larry, with a
big oath; ‘it would be a long time before
I’d take the trouble to care what happened
to you. And since you ask my business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
here, pray what may yours be? You
didn’t think to find Farmer Murray’s
daughter in the marshes at twelve o’clock
at night, did you?’</p>

<p>‘You insolent hound! how dare you
take that young lady’s name upon your
lips in my presence?’</p>

<p>‘I’ve as good a right to name her as
you have—perhaps better. It was at her
bidding I came here to-night. Did she
send you here, too?’</p>

<p>‘I shall not condescend to answer your
question nor to link our names together.
Do you know what you are?’</p>

<p>‘I know what <i>you</i> are, Mr Darley, and
that’s a villain!’</p>

<p>Poor Larry had said he would have it
out with him, and he thought his time had
come. A sudden thought flashed through
Darley’s brain that here was the informer
who had stopped his little game with the
farmer’s pretty daughter.</p>

<p>‘Are you the man,’ he demanded
fiercely, ‘who has thought fit to inform
Mr Murray of my antecedents?’</p>

<p>‘Antecedents’ was a long word for
Larry’s comprehension, but he grasped the
meaning somehow.</p>

<p>‘If you’d say, am I the man who told
the master that you have got a wife and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
children down in Devonshire, I answer
“Yes;” and I hope he’s told you of it, and
kicked you out of the barn to-night for a
scoundrel, as you are, to try and make love
to his daughter.’</p>

<p>‘You brute!’ cried Darley, throwing off
his coat; ‘I’ll be revenged on you for this
if there’s any strength left in my arm.’</p>

<p>‘All right,’ replied the young country-man;
‘I’ve longed to punch your head
many and many a day. I’m glad it’s
come at last. There’s plenty of room for
us to have it out here, and the devil take
the hindmost.’</p>

<p>He flew at his adversary as he spoke,
and fastened his hands on to his coat-collar.
Larry was the younger and the
stronger built man of the two; but Frederick
Darley had had the advantage of a
politer education, in which the use of his
fists was included, so that after a very
little while it would have been evident to
any bystander that Barnes was getting
the worst of it. He had energy and
muscle and right on his side, but his
antagonist, unfortunately, possessed the
skill, and after he had stood on the defensive
four or five times, he seized his
opportunity, and with a dexterous twist
threw Larry heavily from him on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
ground. The young man fell backward,
crashing his skull against a projecting
fragment of rock, and then lay there,
bleeding and unconscious. Darley glanced
around him—not a creature was in sight.
The broad harvest moon looked down
placidly upon the deed of blood he had
just committed, but human eyes to see it
there were none. Finding that Barnes
neither stirred nor groaned, he stooped
down after a while, and laid his hand upon
his heart. It had stopped beating. The
body was getting cold. The man was
dead!</p>

<p>Darley had not intended this, and it
alarmed him terribly. His first idea was
what he should do to secure his own
safety. If he left the body there, would
it be discovered, and the guilt traced home
to him, or would the in-coming tide carry
it out to sea, and wash it up again, weeks
hence perhaps, as a drowned corpse upon
the shore? He thought it might. He
hoped it would. He remembered Larry’s
words, that Miss Rosa had sent him there
that night. It was known, then, that he
had gone to the marshes, and the fact was
favourable.</p>

<p>He dragged the corpse a little way
upon the sands that it might the sooner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
be covered by the water; but finding it
left deep traces of its progress, he lifted
it with some difficulty upon his shoulders,
and after carrying it perhaps a couple of
dozen yards towards the sea, flung it with
all his force before him. What was his
amazement at seeing the body immediately
sink in what appeared to be the solid
ground, and disappear from view? Was
it magic, or did his senses deceive him?
Darley rubbed his eyes once or twice, but
the miracle remained the same. The sand,
with its smooth, shining surface, was before
him, but the corpse of Larry Barnes
had vanished. With a feeling of the
keenest relief—such relief as the cowardly
murderer who has cheated the gallows
must experience—the gamekeeper settled
his clothes, glanced once or twice fearfully
around him, and then, retracing his steps,
ran until he had gained the high road to
Rooklands. But retribution dogged his
murderous feet, and he was destined never
to reach his master’s home. When the
morning dawned upon Corston, a fearful
tale was going the round of its cottages.
The dead body of Lord Worcester’s gamekeeper
had been found on the borders of
the estate, shot through the heart, as
it was supposed, in an encounter with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
poachers, as traces of a fierce struggle
were plainly visible around him.</p>

<p>And Laurence Barnes was missing!</p>

<p>The two circumstances put together
seemed to provide a solution of the mystery.
Everyone in Corston knew that
poor Larry had not been entirely free
from the suspicion of poaching, and most
people had heard him abuse Frederick
Darley, and vow to have vengeance upon
him. What more likely, then, that Larry,
having been taken at his old tricks, had
discharged his rusty gun at the gamekeeper,
and sent him out of the world to
answer for all his errors. This was the
light by which Corston folk read the undiscovered
tragedy. All, that is to say,
but two, and those two were the dead
man’s mother and his betrothed, who knew
of his visit to the Point, and fully believed
that old Whisker had carried him off.</p>

<p>The murder of Frederick Darley made
quite a sensation in Corston. Lord Worcester
gave his late gamekeeper a handsome
funeral, and monument in the churchyard;
and Rosa Murray lost her spirits
and her looks, and wore a black ribbon
on her bonnet for three months, although
she dared not let her father know the
reason why. But Darley had been so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
generally disliked that, when the first
horror at his death had subsided, people
began to think he was a very good riddance,
and though Rosa still looked grave
if anyone mentioned his name, there was
a certain young farmer who rode over from
Wells to see her every Sunday, on whom
the gossips said she seemed to look with
considerable favour. And so, in due course
of time, the name of Darley appeared
likely to become altogether forgotten.</p>

<p>But not so Larry Barnes. Larry was a
native of Corston, and had been a general
favourite there, and his mother still lived
amongst them to keep his memory green.
No one in the village thought Larry was
dead, except Lizzie and Mrs Barnes. The
rustics believed that, finding he had shot
Darley, he had become alarmed and ran
away—left the country, perhaps, in one of
the numerous fishing smacks that infest
the coast, and gone to make his fortune
in the ‘Amerikys.’ Larry would come
back some day—they were assured of
that—when the present lord was dead and
gone, perhaps, and the whole affair was
forgotten; but they were certain he was
alive, simply because they were. But
Lizzie Locke knew otherwise—Lizzie
Locke, to whom a glimpse of heaven had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
been opened the day of his death, and
to whom the outer life must be as dark
as the inner henceforward. She mourned
for Larry far more than his mother did.
Mrs Barnes had lived the best part of her
life, and her joys and her sorrows were
well-nigh over, but the poor blind girl had
only waked up to a consciousness of what
life might hold for her on the awful day
on which hope seemed blotted out for
ever. From the moment her cousin left
the barn at Rosa’s bidding, Lizzie drooped
like a faded flower. That he never returned
from that fatal quest was no surprise
to her. She had known that he would
never return. She had waited where he
had left her till all the merry-making was
over, and then she had gone home to her
aunt, meek, unrepining, but certain of her
doom. She had never been much of a
talker, but she seldom opened her mouth,
except it was absolutely necessary, after
that day. But she would take her basket
whenever the tide was low, and walk down
to Corston Point and sit there—sometimes
gathering cockles, but oftener talking to
the dead, and telling him how much she
had loved him. The few who had occasionally
overheard her soliloquies said
they were uncanny, and that Lizzie Locke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
was losing her wits as well as her eyes.
But the blind girl never altered her course.
Corston Point became her home, and whenever
it was uncovered by the tide, she
might be seen sitting there beside her
cockle basket, waiting for—she knew not
what, talking to—she knew not whom.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The autumn had passed, and the winter
tides had set in. Rosa Murray never rode
upon the Corston marshes now—she was
more pleasantly engaged traversing the
leafless lanes with the young farmer from
Wells. Most people would have thought
the fireside a better place to mourn one’s
dead by than out on the bleak marsh; yet
Lizzie Locke, despite her cotton clothing
and bare head, still took her way there
every morning, her patient, sightless eyes
refusing to reveal the depths of sorrow
that lay beneath them. One day, however,
Mrs Barnes felt disposed to be impatient
with the girl. She had left the house at
eight o’clock in the morning and had not
returned home since, and now it was dark,
and the neighbours began to say it was
not safe that Lizzie should remain out
alone on such a bitter night, and that her
aunt should enforce her authority to prevent
such lengthy rambles. Two or three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
of the men went out with lanterns to try
and find her, but returned unsuccessful,
and they supposed she must have taken
shelter at some friend’s house for the night.
Lizzie Locke knew the marshes well, they
said (no one in Corston better), and would
never be so foolish as to tempt Providence
by traversing them in the dark, for the
currents were at their worst now, and the
quicksands were shifting daily. The logs
and spars of a ruined wreck of a year before
had all come to the surface again within a
few days, and with them a keg of pork,
preserved by the saline properties of the
ground in which it had been treasured, so
that its contents were as fresh as though
they had been found yesterday. Inquiries
were made for the blind girl throughout
the village, but no one had seen anything
of her, and all that her friends could do
was to search for her the first thing in the
morning, when a large party set out for
Corston Point, Mrs Barnes amongst them.
Their faces were sad, for they had little
hope that the cruel tide had not crawled
over the watching girl before she was
aware of it, and carried her out to sea.
But as they neared the Point they discovered
something still crouched upon the
sand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p>‘It can’t be Lizzie,’ said the men, drawing
closer to each other, though a bright,
cold sun was shining over the February
morning. ‘It can’t be nothing mortal,
sitting there in the frost, with the icy waves
lapping over its feet.’</p>

<p>But Mrs Barnes, who had rushed forward,
waved her arms wildly, and called
to them,—</p>

<p>‘<i>It’s him!</i> It’s my Larry, washed up
again by the sands; and poor Lizzie has
found him out by the touch of her finger.’</p>

<p>The men ran up to the spot, and looked
upon the sight before them. The corpse
of Larry Barnes, with not so much as a
feature changed by the hand of Time—with
all his clothes intact and whole, and a
bunch of samphire in his breast—lay out
upon the shining sands, stiff as marble, but
without any trace of decomposition upon
his fresh young features and stalwart limbs.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
And beside him, with her cheek bowed
down upon his own, knelt Lizzie Locke.
Lizzie, who had braved the winter’s frost,
and withstood the cold of a February night,
in order to watch beside the recovered
body of her lover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>‘Lizzie!’ exclaimed Mrs Barnes. ‘Look
up now; I’ve come to comfort thee! Let
us thank Heaven that he’s found again,
and the evil words they spoke of him must
be took back.’</p>

<p>But the blind girl neither spoke nor
stirred.</p>

<p>‘Can’t thee answer, my lass?’ said
Isaac the poacher, as he shook her by
the arm.</p>

<p>The answer that she made was by falling
backwards and disclosing her fair, gentle
face—white and rigid as her lover’s.</p>

<p>‘Merciful God! she is dead!’ they
cried.</p>

<p>Yes, they were right. She was dead—she
was at rest. What she had waited for
she had found. What she had striven for
she had gained. How many of us can say
the same? Larry had been restored to
her. The shifting quicksand had thrown
him upon earth again, and had she not
been there, his body might have been
washed out to sea, and no further knowledge
gained of his fate. But she had
saved his dust for consecrated ground—more,
she had saved his character for the
healing of his mother’s heart. For in his
breast there still reposed the bunch of
samphire he had perilled his life to gather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
for the farmer’s daughter, and, grasped
tight in his hand, they found the neckcloth
of Lord Worcester’s gamekeeper—a crimson,
silk neckcloth, recognised by all three—and
which Larry had seized and held in
the last deadly struggle. And the men of
Corston looked on it and knew the truth—that
their comrade was no murderer, but
had fallen where he was found in a quarrel
(probably pre-arranged) with Frederick
Darley; and they cursed the gamekeeper
in their hearts.</p>

<p>But Lizzie was at rest—happy Lizzie
Locke! sleeping in the quiet churchyard
at Corston, with her cheek pillowed on her
Larry’s breast.</p>

<p class="dropcap">‘On the banks of the Wye, Monmouthshire.—To
be Let, furnished,
a commodious Family
Mansion, surrounded with park-like
grounds. Stabling and every convenience.
Only two and a-half miles from
station, church, and post-office. Excellent
fishing to be procured in the neighbourhood.
Rent nominal to a responsible
tenant.’</p>

<p>Such, with a few trifling additions, was
the advertisement that caught my eye in
the spring of 18—.</p>

<p>‘My dear Jane,’ I said, as I handed the
paper over to my wife, ‘this, I think, is
the very thing we want.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>I was a London practitioner, with a
numerous family and a large circle of
patients; but the two facts, though blessings
in themselves, were not without their
disadvantages.</p>

<p>The hostages which I had given to
fortune had made that strenuous action
which attention to my numerous patients
supplied incumbent on me; but the consequent
anxiety and want of rest had drawn
so largely on my mental and physical
resources, that there was no need for my
professional brethren to warn me of the
necessity of change and country air. I
felt myself that I was breaking down, and
had already made arrangements with a
friend to take my practice for a few
months, and set me at liberty to attend to
my own health. And being passionately
fond of fishing, and all country pleasures
and pursuits, and looking forward with zest
to a period of complete quiet, the residence
alluded to (if it fulfilled the promise of its
advertisement) appeared to be all that I
could desire.</p>

<p>‘Park-like grounds!’ exclaimed my wife,
with animation. ‘How the dear children
will enjoy themselves.’</p>

<p>‘And two and a-half miles from church
or station,’ I responded eagerly. ‘No<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
neighbours, excellent fishing, and at a
nominal rent. It sounds too good to be
true.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Arthur! you must write, and obtain
all the particulars this very day. If you
put it off, some one will be sure to take
the house before we have time to do so.’</p>

<p>‘I shall go and see the city agents at
once,’ I replied, resolutely. ‘It is too rare
an opportunity to be lost. Only, don’t
raise your hopes too high, my dear. Advertisements
are apt to be deceptive.’</p>

<p>But when I had seen Messrs Quibble &amp;
Lye on the subject, it really seemed as
though for once they had spoken the truth.
Rushmere, the house in question, had been
built and furnished for his own use by an
old gentleman, who died shortly afterwards,
and his heirs, not liking the situation,
had placed the property in the agents’
hands for letting. The owners were
wealthy, cared little for money, and had
authorised the agents to let the house on
any reasonable terms, and it was really a
bargain to anyone that wanted it. They
frankly admitted that the loneliness of the
position of Rushmere was the reason of its
cheapness; but when I heard the rent at
which they offered to let me take it, if
approved of, for three months, I was quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
ready to agree with Messrs Quibble &amp;
Lye in their idea of a bargain, and that,
for those who liked solitude, Rushmere
offered extraordinary advantages.</p>

<p>Armed with the necessary authority, I
found my way down into Monmouthshire, to
inspect the premises on the following day;
and when I saw Rushmere, I felt still more
disposed to be surprised at the opportunity
afforded me, and to congratulate myself on
the promptitude with which I had embraced
it. I found it to be a good-sized country
house, comfortably furnished, and, to all
appearance, well built, standing in enclosed
grounds, and on a healthy elevation; but,
notwithstanding its isolated situation, I
was too much a man of the world to believe,
under the circumstances, that its greatest
disadvantage lay in that fact. Accordingly,
I peered eagerly about for damp
walls, covered cesspools, unsteady joists,
or tottering foundations, but I could find
none.</p>

<p>‘The chimneys smoke, I suppose?’ I
remarked, in a would-be careless tone, to
the old woman whom I found in charge of
the house, and who crept after me where-ever
I went.</p>

<p>‘Chimbleys smoke, sir? Not as I knows
of.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>‘The roof leaks, perhaps?’</p>

<p>‘Deary me, no. You won’t find a spot
of damp, look where you may.’</p>

<p>‘Then there’s been a fever, or some
infectious disorder in the house?’</p>

<p>‘A fever, sir? Why, the place has been
empty these six months. The last tenants
left at Christmas.’</p>

<p>‘Empty for six months!’ I exclaimed.
‘How long is it, then, since the gentleman
who built it died?’</p>

<p>‘Old Mr Bennett, sir? He’s been dead
a matter of fifteen years or more.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed! Then why don’t the owners
of the place sell it, instead of letting it
stand vacant?’ thought I to myself.</p>

<p>But I did not say so to the old woman,
who was looking up in my face, as though
anxious to learn what my decision would
be.</p>

<p>‘No vermin, I hope?’ I suggested, as a
last resource. ‘You are not troubled with
rats or mice at night, are you?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I don’t sleep here at night, sir,
thank heaven!’ she answered in a manner
which appeared to me unnecessarily energetic.
‘I am only employed by day to air
the house, and show it to strangers. I go
home to my own people at night.’</p>

<p>‘And where do your people live?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p>‘Better than half a mile from here, sir,
and ours is the nearest cottage to Rushmere.’</p>

<p>And then—apprehensive, perhaps, that
her information might prove a drawback
to the letting of the property—she added,
quickly,—</p>

<p>‘Not but what it’s a nice place to live
in, is Rushmere, and very convenient,
though a bit lonesome.’</p>

<p>I perfectly agreed with her, the ‘lonesomeness’
of the situation proving no
detraction in my eyes.</p>

<p>On my return to London I gave my
wife so glowing a description of the house
and its surroundings, that she urged me to
conclude the bargain at once; and, in the
course of a few weeks, I and my family
were transplanted from the purlieus of
Bayswater to the banks of the Wye. It
was the middle of May when we took possession,
and the country wore its most
attractive garb. The children were wild
with delight at being let loose in the flower-bespangled
fields, and, as I watched the
tributaries of the river, and perceived the
excellent sport they promised me, I felt
scarcely less excited than the children.
Only my wife, I thought, became inoculated
with some of the absurd fears of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
domestics we had brought with us from
town, and seemed to consider the locality
more lonely and unprotected than she had
expected to find it.</p>

<p>‘It’s a charming place, Arthur,’ she acknowledged,
‘and marvellously cheap; but
it is certainly a long way from other houses.
I find we shall have to send for everything
to the town. Not even the country carts,
with butter and poultry, seem to call at
Rushmere.’</p>

<p>‘My dear Jane, I told you distinctly that
it was two and a-half miles from church or
station, and you read it for yourself in the
paper. But I thought we looked out for a
retreat where we should run no risk of
being intruded on by strangers.’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, of course; only there are not
even any farmhouses or cottages near
Rushmere, you see; and it would be so
very easy for anyone to break in at night,
and rob us.’</p>

<p>‘Pooh, nonsense! What will you be
afraid of next? The locks and bolts are
perfectly secure, and both Dawson and I
have firearms, and are ready to use them.
Your fears are childish, Janie.’</p>

<p>But all my arguments were unavailing,
and each day my wife grew more nervous,
and less willing to be left alone. So much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
so, indeed, that I made a practice of seeing
that the house fastenings were properly
secured each night myself, and of keeping
a loaded revolver close to my hand, in case
of need. But it damped my pleasure to
find that Jane was not enjoying herself;
and the country looked less beautiful to me
than it had done at first. One night I
suddenly awoke, to find that she was
sitting up in bed, and in an attitude of expectation.</p>

<p>‘My dear, what is the matter with you?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, hush! I am sure that I hear footsteps
on the stairs—footsteps creeping up
and down.’</p>

<p>I listened with her, but could detect no
sound whatever.</p>

<p>‘Lie down again, Jane—it is only your
imagination. Every one is fast asleep in
bed.’</p>

<p>‘I assure you, Arthur, I am not mistaken.
Once they came quite near the door.’</p>

<p>‘If so, it can only be one of the servants.
You don’t wish me to get up and encounter
Mary or Susan in her night-dress, do you?
Consider my morals!’</p>

<p>‘Oh no, of course not,’ she replied with
a faint smile; yet it was some time before
she fell to sleep again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>It was not many nights before my wife
roused me again with the same complaint.</p>

<p>‘Arthur, don’t call me silly, but I am
<i>certain</i> I heard something.’</p>

<p>To appease her fears, I shook off my
drowsiness, and, with a lighted candle,
made a tour of the house; but all was as I
had left it.</p>

<p>Once, indeed, I imagined that I heard
at my side the sound of a quick breathing;
but that I knew must be sheer fancy, since
I was alone.</p>

<p>The only circumstance that startled me
was finding Dawson, the man servant, who
slept on the ground floor, also awake, and
listening at his door.</p>

<p>‘What roused you, Dawson?’</p>

<p>‘Well, sir, I can hardly say; but I
fancied I heard some one going up the
stairs a little while ago.’</p>

<p>‘You heard me coming down, you mean.’</p>

<p>‘No, sir, begging your pardon, it was
footsteps going up—lighter than yours, sir.
More like those of a woman.’</p>

<p>Yet, though I privately interrogated the
female servants on the following day, I
could not discover that any of them had
been out of their beds; and I forbore to
tell my wife what Dawson had said in
corroboration of her statement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>Only I was as much annoyed as astonished
when, as I finished my catechism
of Mary, our head nurse, she informed me
that she had made up her mind to leave
our service. Mary—my wife’s right hand—who
had been with us ever since the
birth of our first child! The announcement
took me completely aback.</p>

<p>‘What on earth is your reason for leaving
us?’ I demanded angrily; for I knew
what a blow her decision would be to Jane.
‘What have you to find fault with?’</p>

<p>‘Nothing with you or the mistress, sir;
but I can’t remain in this house. I wouldn’t
stay in it a night longer, if it were possible
to get away; and I do hope you and Mrs
Delamere will let me go as soon as ever
you can, sir, as it will be the death of me.’</p>

<p>‘What will be the death of you?’</p>

<p>‘The footsteps, sir, and the voices,’ she
answered, crying. ‘I can hear them about
the nurseries all night long, and it’s more
than any mortal can stand—it is, indeed.’</p>

<p>‘Are you infected with the same folly?’
I exclaimed. ‘I see what it is, Dawson
has been talking to you. I didn’t know
I had such a couple of fools in my establishment.’</p>

<p>‘Mr Dawson has said nothing to me
about nothing, sir,’ she answered. ‘I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
hear what I hear with my own ears; and I
wouldn’t stay a week longer in this ’aunted
place, not if you was to strew the floor
with golden guineas for me.’</p>

<p>Not possessing either the capability or
the inclination to test Mary’s fidelity by
the means she alluded to, and finding her
determination unalterable, I gave her the
desired permission to depart; only making
it a stipulation that she should not tell her
mistress the real reason for her leaving us,
but ascribe it to bad news from home, or
any other cause.</p>

<p>But though I could not but believe that
the woman’s idiotic terrors had blinded
her judgment, I was extremely surprised
to find she should have been so led astray,
as I had always considered Mary to possess
a remarkably clear head and good moral
sense. The wailing and lamentation, from
both mother and children, at the announcement
of her departure made me still more
angry with her obstinacy and folly. But
she continued resolute; and we were driven
to try and secure some one to fulfil her
duties from the neighbouring town. But
here a strange difficulty met us. We saw
several fresh, rosy-cheeked maidens, who
appeared quite willing to undertake our
service, until they heard where we resided,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
when, by an extraordinary coincidence,
one and all discovered that some insurmountable
obstacle prevented their coming
at all. When the same thing had occurred
several times in succession, and Jane appeared
worn out with disappointment and
fatigue, the landlord of the inn where we
had put up for the day appeared at the
door, and beckoned me out.</p>

<p>‘May I make bold enough to ask if you
want a servant to go to Rushmere?’ he
inquired of me in a whisper.</p>

<p>‘Certainly, we do. Our nurse has been
obliged to leave us suddenly, and we want
some one to supply her place.’</p>

<p>‘Then you may give it up as a bad job,
sir; for you’ll never get one of the country
people here about to set a foot in Rushmere—not
if you were to live there till the
day of your death.’</p>

<p>‘And why not?’ I demanded, with
affected ignorance.</p>

<p>‘What! haven’t you heard nothing since
you’ve been there, sir?’</p>

<p>‘Heard? What should I have heard,
except the ordinary noises of the household?’</p>

<p>‘Well, you’re lucky if you’ve escaped
so far,’ returned the landlord, mysteriously;
‘but it ain’t for long. No one who lives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
in Rushmere lives there <i>alone</i>. I can tell
you the whole story if you like?’</p>

<p>‘I have no desire to listen to any such
folly,’ I replied, testily. ‘I am not superstitious,
and do not believe in supernatural
sights or sounds. If the people round
about here are foolish enough to do so, I
cannot help it; but I will not have the
minds of my wife or family imbued with
their nonsense.’</p>

<p>‘Very good, sir; I hope you may be
able to say as much two months hence,’
said the man, civilly.</p>

<p>And so we parted.</p>

<p>I returned to Janie, and persuaded her
he had told me that all the girls of that town
had a strong objection to leave it, which
was the reason they refused to take service
in the country. I reminded her that Susan
was quite competent to take charge of the
whole flock until we returned to London;
and it would be better after all to put up
with a little inconvenience than to introduce
a stranger to the nursery. So my
wife, who was disappointed with the failure
of her enterprise, fell in with my ideas,
and we returned to Rushmere, determined
to do as best we could with Susan only.</p>

<p>But I could not forget the landlord’s
earnestness, and, notwithstanding my incredulity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
began to wish we were well out
of Rushmere.</p>

<p>For a few days after Mary’s departure
we slept in peace; but then the question
of the mysterious footsteps assumed a
graver aspect, for my wife and I were
roused from deep slumber one night by a
loud knock upon the bedroom door, and
springing up to answer it, I encountered,
on the threshold, Dawson, pale with fright,
and trembling in every limb.</p>

<p>‘What do you mean by alarming your
mistress in this way?’ I inquired, angrily.</p>

<p>‘I’m very sorry, sir,’ he replied, with
chattering teeth, ‘but I thought it my duty
to let you know. There’s some one in the
house to-night, sir. I can hear them whispering
together at this moment; and so
can you, if you will but listen.’</p>

<p>I advanced at once to the banisters, and
certainly heard what seemed to be the sound
of distant voices engaged in altercation;
and, light in hand, followed by Dawson,
I dashed down the staircase without further
ceremony, in hopes of trapping the intruders.</p>

<p>But all in vain. Though we entered
every room in turn, not a soul was visible.</p>

<p>I came to the conclusion that the whole
alarm was due to Dawson’s cowardice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>‘You contemptible fool, you are as
chicken-hearted as a woman!’ I said, contemptuously.
‘You hear the frogs croaking
in the mere, or the wind blowing through
the rushes, and you immediately conclude
the house is full of thieves.’</p>

<p>‘I didn’t say it was thieves,’ the man
interposed, sullenly; but I took no notice
of the muttered remark.</p>

<p>‘If you are afraid to sleep downstairs by
yourself,’ I continued, ‘say so; but don’t
come alarming your mistress again, in the
middle of the night, for I won’t allow it.’</p>

<p>The man slunk back into his room, with
a reiteration that he had not been mistaken;
and I returned to bed, full of complaints at
having been so unnecessarily roused.</p>

<p>‘If this kind of thing goes on,’ I remarked
to my wife, ‘I shall regret ever
having set eyes on Rushmere. That a
pack of silly maid-servants should see a
robber in every bush is only to be expected;
but how a sensible man like Dawson,
and a woman of education like yourself,
can permit your imagination to betray
you into such foolish fears, is quite past my
comprehension.’</p>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding my dose of philosophy,
poor Jane looked so pale upon the
following morning, that I was fain to devise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
and carry into execution a little excursion
into the neighbouring country before she
regained her usual composure.</p>

<p>Some time passed without any further
disturbance, and though upon several occasions
I blamed myself for having brought
a family, used to a populous city like
London, to vegetate in so isolated a spot
as Rushmere, I had almost forgotten the circumstances
that had so much annoyed me.</p>

<p>We had now spent a month in our temporary
home. The fields and hedgerows
were bright with summer flowers, and the
children passed most of their time tumbling
amongst the new-mown hay. Janie had
once more regained courage to sit by herself
in the dusk, and to rest with tolerable
security when she went to bed. I was rejoicing
in the idea that all the folly that
had marred the pleasure of our arrival at
Rushmere had died a natural death, when
it was vividly and painfully recalled to my
mind by its actual recurrence.</p>

<p>Our second girl, a delicate little creature
of about six years old, who, since the departure
of her nurse, had slept in a cot in
the same room as ourselves, woke me up
in the middle of the night by exclaiming,
in a frightened, plaintive voice, close to
my ear,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>‘Papa! papa! do you hear the footsteps?
Some one is coming up the stairs!’</p>

<p>The tone was one of terror, and it roused
my wife and myself instantly. The child
was cold, and shaking all over with alarm,
and I placed her by her mother’s side before
I left the room to ascertain if there was any
truth in her assertion.</p>

<p>‘Arthur, Arthur! I hear them as plainly
as can be,’ exclaimed my wife, who was as
terrified as the child. ‘They are on the
second landing. There is no mistake about
it this time.’</p>

<p>I listened at the half-opened door, and
was compelled to agree with her. From
whatever cause they arose, footsteps were
to be distinctly heard upon the staircase—sometimes
advancing, and then retreating,
as though afraid to venture farther; but,
still, not to be mistaken for anything but
the sound of feet.</p>

<p>With a muttered exclamation, I seized
my revolver.</p>

<p>‘Don’t be alarmed,’ I said, hurriedly;
‘there is not the slightest occasion for it.
And, whatever happens, do not venture on
the landing. I shall be quite safe.’</p>

<p>And without further preamble, only desirous
to settle the business once for all,
and give the intruders on my domains a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
sharp lesson on the laws of <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>,
I sprang down the staircase. I had not
stayed to strike a light; but the moon
was shining blandly in at the uncurtained
passage window, and the landing was as
bright as day. Yet I saw no one there.
The thief (if thief it were) must have
already taken the alarm, and descended to
the lowest regions. I fancied I could
detect the same footsteps, but more distinctly
marked, walk by me with a hurried,
frightened movement, accompanied by a
quick, sobbing breath; and, as I paused to
consider what such a mystery could indicate,
a pair of heavily-shod feet rushed past me,
or seemed to rush, upon the stairs. I heard
an angry shout commingle with a faint
cry of terror below the landing whereon I
stood; then, the discharge of a firearm,
followed by a low groan of pain—and all
was still.</p>

<p>Dark and mysterious though it appeared
to be, I did not dream of ascribing the
circumstance to any but a natural cause.
But there was evidently no time for hesitation,
and in another moment I had flown
down the stairs, and stood in the moonlighted
hall. It was empty! Chairs, table,
hatstand, stood in their accustomed places;
the children’s garden hats and my fishing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
tackle were strewn about; but of animated
nature there was not a sign, of the recent
scuffle not a trace!</p>

<p>All was quiet, calm, and undisturbed,
and, as I gazed around in mute bewilderment,
the perspiration stood in thick drops
upon my brow and chin.</p>

<p>My first collected thought was for my
wife and the best means by which to prevent
her sharing the mystification and
dread which I have no hesitation in confessing
that I now experienced; but as I
turned to remount the staircase, I caught
sight of some dark mass lying at the further
end of the passage, and going up to it,
found to my surprise the body of Dawson,
cold and insensible.</p>

<p>The explanation of the mystery was
before me—so I immediately determined.
The man, whom I knew to be replete with
superstitious terror, imagining he heard
the unaccountable noise of footsteps, had
evidently supplied that which had reached
my ear, and in his alarm at my approach
had discharged his firearm at the supposed
marauder. Pleasant for me if he had taken
a better aim: So I thought as I dragged
his unconscious body into his bedroom,
and busied myself by restoring it to
sensation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>As soon as he opened his eyes, and was
sufficiently recovered to answer me, I
asked,—</p>

<p>‘What on earth made you discharge
your gun, Dawson? I must take it out
of your keeping, if your are so careless
about using it.’</p>

<p>‘I didn’t fire, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Nonsense! you don’t know what you
are talking about. I heard the shot distinctly
as I came downstairs.’</p>

<p>‘I am only telling you the truth, sir.
There is the fowling-piece in that corner.
I have not drawn the trigger since you
last loaded it.’</p>

<p>I went up and examined the weapon.
What Dawson had said was correct. It
had not been used.</p>

<p>‘Then who did fire?’ I said, impatiently.
‘I could swear to having heard
the report.’</p>

<p>‘And so could I, sir. It was that that
knocked me over.’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, sir, pray take the mistress and the
children away from this place as soon as
possible. It’s no robbers that go up and
down these stairs of nights, sir. It’s something
much worse than that.’</p>

<p>‘Dawson, if you begin to talk such folly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
to me, I’ll discharge you on the spot. I
believe the whole lot of you have gone
mad.’</p>

<p>‘But listen to my story, sir. I had gone
to bed last night, as tired as possible, and
thinking of nothing but getting a good
long sleep. The first thing that roused
me was some one trying the handle of my
door. I lay and listened to it for some
time before I was fully awake, and then I
thought maybe you wanted something out
of my room, and was trying not to wake
me; so I got out of bed and opened the
door. But there was nobody there, though
I fancied I heard some one breathing hard
a few yards off from me. Well, I thought
to myself, sir, this is all nonsense; so I
came back to bed again, and lay down.
But I couldn’t sleep; for directly the door
was closed, I heard the footsteps again,
creep, creeping along the passage and the
wall, as though some one was crouching
and feeling his way as he went. Then the
handle of the door began to creak and turn
again—I saw it turn, sir, with my own eyes,
backwards and forwards, a dozen times in
the moonlight; and then I heard a heavier
step come stumbling downstairs, and there
seemed to be a kind of scuffle. I couldn’t
stand it no longer, so I opened the door<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
again; and then, as I’m a living Christian,
sir, I heard a woman’s voice say ‘Father!’
with a kind of sob, and as the sound was
uttered there came a report from the first
landing, and the sound of a fall, and a deep
groan in the passage below. And it seemed
to go right through me, and curdle my
blood, and I fell all of a heap where you
found me. And it’s nothing natural, sir,
you may take my word for it; and harm
will come of your stopping in this house.’</p>

<p>So saying, poor Dawson, who seemed
in real earnest, fell back on his pillow with
a heavy sigh.</p>

<p>‘Dawson,’ I said, critically, ‘what did
you eat for supper last night?’</p>

<p>‘You’re never going to put down what
I’ve told you, sir, to supper. I took nothing
but a little cold meat, upon my word. And
I was as sensible, till that shot knocked
me over, as you are this moment.’</p>

<p>‘Do you mean to tell me that you seriously
believe the report of a firearm could have
reached your ears without one having been
discharged?’</p>

<p>‘But didn’t you say you heard it yourself,
sir?’</p>

<p>This knocked me over, and I did not
know what to answer him. In the attempt
to allay what I considered his unreasonable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
fear, I had forgotten my own experience in
the matter. And I knew that I had heard,
or imagined I heard, a shot fired, and it
would be very difficult for any one to persuade
me I was mistaken. Still, though I
held no belief in supernatural agencies, I
was an earnest student of the philosophical
and metaphysical school of Germany, and
acquainted with all the revealed wonders
of magnetism and animal electricity. It
was impossible to say whether some such
effect as I have described might not have
been produced upon my brain by the reflection
of the fear or fancy on that of my servant;
and that as he had imagined the
concussion of firearms, so I might have
instantaneously received the impression of
his mind. It was a nice question for
argument, and not one to be thought over
at that moment. All my present business
lay in the effort to disabuse Dawson’s mind
of the reality of the shock it had received.</p>

<p>‘I said I fancied I heard something like
the report of a firearm; but as none had
been fired, of course I must have been
mistaken. Come, Dawson, I must go
back, or Mrs Delamere will wonder what
has become of me. I conclude you are
not such a coward as to be afraid to be
left by yourself?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>‘I never feared a man in my life, sir;
but the strongest heart can’t stand up
against spirits.’</p>

<p>‘Spirits!’ I exclaimed, angrily. ‘I wonder
what on earth you will talk to me about
next? Now, I’ll tell you what it is, Dawson—if
I hear anything more of this, or am
disturbed again at night by your folly, I’ll
pack you back to London without a character.
Do you understand me?’</p>

<p>‘I understand you, sir,’ the man answered,
humbly; and thereupon I left him to himself.</p>

<p>But, as I reascended the staircase, I was
not satisfied either with my own half-formed
solution of the mystery, or my
servant’s reception of my rebuke. He
evidently would prefer dismissal to passing
such another night. I could read the
resolution in his face, although he had not
expressed it in so many words. When I
reached my wife’s room, I was still more
surprised. Janie and the child lay in a
profound slumber. I had expected to find
both of them in a state of anxious terror to
learn the meaning of the noise that was
going on below; but they had evidently
heard nothing. This welcome fact, however,
only tended to confirm me in the
belief I had commenced to entertain, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
the whole circumstance being due to some,
perhaps yet undiscovered, phase of brain
reading, and I fell to sleep, resolved to
make a deeper study of the marvels propounded
by Mesmer and Kant. When I
awoke, with the bright June sun streaming
in at the windows, I had naturally parted
with much of the impression of the night
before. It is hard to associate any gloomy
or unnatural thoughts with the unlimited
glory of the summer’s sunshine, that streams
into every nook and cranny, and leaves no
shadows anywhere. On this particular
morning it seemed to have cleared the
cobwebs off all our brains. The child had
forgotten all about the occurrence of the
night. I was, as usual, ready to laugh
away all ghostly fears and fancies; and
even Janie seemed to regard the matter as
one of little moment.</p>

<p>‘What was the matter last night, Arthur,
dear?’ she asked, when the subject recurred
to her memory. ‘I was so sleepy
I couldn’t keep awake till you came up
again.’</p>

<p>‘Didn’t you hear the fearful battle I held
with the goblins in the hall?’ I demanded,
gaily, though I put the question with a purpose,—‘the
shots that were exchanged
between us, and the groans of the defeated,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
as they slunk away into their haunted coal-cellars
and cupboards?’</p>

<p>‘Arthur, what nonsense! Was there
any noise?’</p>

<p>‘Well, I frightened Dawson, and Dawson
frightened me; and we squabbled over
it for the best part of an hour. I thought
our talking might have disturbed you.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed, it didn’t, then. But don’t
mention it before Cissy, Arthur, even in
fun, for she declares she heard some one
walking about the room, and I want her
to forget it.’</p>

<p>I dropped the subject; but meeting
Dawson as I was smoking my pipe in the
garden that afternoon, I ventured to rally
him on his fright of the night before, and
to ask if he hadn’t got over it by that time.</p>

<p>‘No, sir; and I never shall,’ he replied,
with a sort of shiver. ‘And I only hope
you may come to be convinced of the truth
of it before it’s too late to prevent harm
you may never cease to repent of.’</p>

<p>There was so much respectful earnestness
in the man’s manner, that I could not
resent his words nor laugh at them, as I
had done before; and I passed by him in
thoughtful silence.</p>

<p>What if there were more in all this than
I had ever permitted myself to imagine?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
What if the assertions of my man-servant,
the unaffected terror of my wife and child,
the fears of my nurse, the evident shrinking
of the old woman who had charge of
the house, the opposition from the servants
of the neighbouring town, combined with
what I had heard myself, were not simple
chimeras of the brain—fancies engendered
by superstition or timidity or ignorance;
but indications of a power beyond our control,
the beginning and the end of which
may alike remain unknown until all things
are revealed? I had, with the majority of
educated men, manfully resisted all temptation
to believe in the possibility of spirits,
of whatever grade, making themselves
either seen or heard by mortal senses. I
use the word ‘manfully,’ although I now
believe it to be the height of manliness to
refuse to discredit that which we cannot
disprove, and to have sufficient humility to
accept the belief that there are more things
in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in
our philosophy. But at that juncture I
should have considered such a concession
both childish and cowardly. Yet, there
was sufficient doubt in my mind, notwithstanding
the glorious June sun, respecting
my adventure of the night before, that I
resolved, whatever happened, that I would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
satisfy myself as to the value of the fears of
those about me.</p>

<p>I could not keep my wife and children
in a house where they might be liable at
any moment to be frightened out of their
seven senses, from whatever cause, without
ascertaining the reason of it. Some
reason there must be, either natural or
otherwise; and I determined, if possible, to
learn it that very night. I would not tell
Dawson or anyone of my intention; but I
would keep watch and ward in the old parlour
on the ground floor, so as to be ready to
rush out at a moment’s notice, and seize any
intruder who might attempt to disturb us.
I still believed—I could not but believe—that
the footsteps which so many of us had
heard were due to some trickster, who
wished to play upon our nerves in that
lonely old house. I had heard of such
things being done, purposely to keep
visitors away; and I determined, whosoever
it might be, whether our own servants
or strangers, that they must take their
chance of being shot down like any other
robber.</p>

<p>According to my resolution, I said
nothing to Janie, but tried to render the
evening as cheerful and merry a one as
possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>I ordered strawberries and cream into
the hay-field, and played with my troop of
little ones there, until they were so tired
they could hardly walk for the short distance
that lay between them and their
beds. As soon as they were dismissed,
and we had returned to the house, I laid
aside the newspapers that had arrived by
that morning’s post, and which I usually
reserved for the evening’s delectation, and
taking my wife upon my knee, as in the
dear old courting days, talked to her until
she had forgotten everything but the topics
on which we conversed, and had no time
to brood upon the coming night, and the
fears it usually engendered. Then, as a
last duty, I carried to Dawson with my
own hands a strong decoction of brandy
and water, with which I had mixed something
that I knew, under ordinary circumstances,
must make him sleep till daylight.</p>

<p>‘Drink this,’ I said to him. ‘From
whatever cause, our nerves were both
shaken last night, and a little stimulant
will do neither of us harm.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, sir,’ he replied, as he
finished the tumbler at a draught; ‘I don’t
deny I’m glad to have it. I dread the
thoughts of the night before us.’</p>

<p>‘Lock your door on the inside,’ I added<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
as I left him, ‘and don’t get up whether
the handle moves or not. Then, at all
events, you will feel secure till the
morrow.’</p>

<p>‘Keys won’t keep <i>them</i> out,’ muttered
Dawson, as he entered his sleeping apartment.</p>

<p>But I would not notice the allusion,
though I understood it.</p>

<p>I went up to bed with my wife as usual;
and it was not until I saw she was sound
asleep that, habited in my dressing-gown
and slippers, I ventured to creep softly out
of the room and take my way downstairs
again.</p>

<p>It was then about twelve o’clock. The
moonlight was as bright as it had been the
night before, and made every object distinctly
visible. From the loud snoring
which proceeded from Dawson’s room, I
concluded that my opiate had taken due
effect, and that I should be permitted to
hold my vigil undisturbed. In one hand I
grasped a loaded revolver, and in the other
a huge knotted stick, so determined was I
not to be taken by my tormentors at a
disadvantage. I turned into the general
sitting-room, which opened on the hall.
All was as we had left it; and I ensconced
myself on one of the large old-fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
sofas, trusting to my curiosity to keep me
awake.</p>

<p>It was weary waiting. I heard one and
then two sound from the big clock in the
hall; still there was no other noise to
break the silence. I began to relapse into
my first belief that the whole business was
due to imagination. From this I passed
to self-satisfaction; self-satisfaction induced
inertion, and inertion brought on heavy
sleep. How long I slept I do not know,
but I had reason afterwards to think, not
more than half-an-hour.</p>

<p>However, that point is immaterial. But
what waked me—waked me so completely
that in a moment all my faculties were as
clear as daylight—was the sound of a
hoarse breathing. I sat up on the sofa
and rubbed my eyes.</p>

<p>The room was fully lighted by the moon.
I could see into each corner. Nothing was
visible. The sound I had heard must then
have proceeded from outside the door,
which was open; and I turned towards it,
fully expecting to see Dawson enter in a
somnambulistic condition, brought on by
his dreams and my soporific.</p>

<p>But he did not appear. I rose and
looked into the hall. It was empty, as
before. Still the breathing continued, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
(as I, with now fully-awakened faculties,
discovered) proceeded from a corner of the
parlour where stood an old-fashioned
secretary and a chair. Not daring to
believe my senses, I advanced to the spot
and listened attentively. The sound continued,
and was unmistakably palpable.
The breathing was hoarse and laboured,
like that of an old man who was suffering
from bronchitis or asthma. Every now
and then it was interrupted by a short,
roupy cough. What I suffered under this
mysterious influence I can hardly tell. Interest
and curiosity got the better of my
natural horror; but even then I could not
but feel that there was something very
awful in this strange contact of sound without
sight. Presently my eyes were attracted
by the chair, which was pushed,
without any visible agency, towards the
wall. Something rose—I could hear the
action of the feet. Something moved—I
could hear it approaching the spot where I
stood motionless. Something brushed past
me, almost roughly—I could feel the contact
of a cloth garment against my dressing-gown,
and heard the sound of coarsely
shod feet leaving the room. My hair was
almost standing on end with terror; but I
was determined to follow the mystery to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
its utmost limits, whether my curiosity
were satisfied by the attempt or not.</p>

<p>I rushed after the clumping feet into the
hall; and I heard them slowly and painfully,
and yet most distinctly, commence to
toil up the staircase. But before they had
reached the first landing, and just as I was
about to follow in their wake, my attention
was distracted by another sound, which
appeared to be close at my elbow—the
sound of which Dawson had complained the
night before—that of a creeping step, and a
stifled sobbing, as though a woman were
feeling her way along the passage in the
dark. I could discern the feeble touch as
it felt along the wall, and then placed an
uncertain hold upon the banisters—could
hear the catching breath, which dared not
rise into a cry, and detect the fear which
caused the feet to advance and retreat, and
advance a little way again, and then stop,
as though dread of some unknown calamity
overpowered every other feeling. Meanwhile,
the clumping steps, that had died
away in the distance, turned, and appeared
to be coming downstairs again. The moon
streamed brightly in at the landing window.
Had a form been visible, it would have
been as distinctly seen as by day. I
experienced a sense of coming horror, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
drew back in the shadow of the wall. As
the heavy footsteps gained the lower landing,
I heard a start—a scuffle—a faint cry
of ‘Father!’ and then a curse—the flash of
a firearm—a groan—and I remember nothing
more.</p>

<p>When I recovered my consciousness, I
was lying on the flat of my back in the
passage, as I had found poor Dawson the
night before, and the morning sun was
shining full upon my face. I sat up,
rubbed my eyes, and tried to remember
how I had come there. Surely the moon
had looked in at that window when I saw
it last. Then in a moment came back
upon my mind all that I had heard whilst
holding my vigil during the past night;
and I sprang to my feet, to see if I could
discover any traces of the tragedy which
seemed to have been enacted in my very
presence.</p>

<p>But it was in vain I searched the parlour,
the passage, and the stairs. Everything
remained in its usual place. Even the
chair, which I could swear I saw pushed
against the wall, was now standing primly
before the secretary, and the door of the
room was closed, as it usually was when we
retired for the night. I slunk up to my
dressing-room, anxious that my wife should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
not discover that I had never retired to
rest; and having plunged my head and
face into cold water, took my way across
the sunlighted fields, to see if the fresh
morning air might not be successful in
clearing away the confusion with which my
brain was oppressed. But I had made up
my mind on one point, and that was that
we would move out of Rushmere as soon
as it was possible to do so. After a stroll
of a couple of hours, I re-approached the
house. The first person I encountered
was the under nurse, Susan, who ran to
meet me with a perturbed countenance.</p>

<p>‘Oh, sir, I’m so thankful you’ve come
back! Dawson has been looking for you
for the last hour, for poor missus is so ill,
and we don’t know what on earth to do
with her.’</p>

<p>‘Ill! In what way?’ I demanded quickly.</p>

<p>‘That’s what we can’t make out, sir.
Miss Cissy came up crying to the nursery,
the first thing this morning, to tell me that
her mamma had tumbled out of bed, and
wouldn’t speak to her; and she couldn’t
find her papa. So I ran downstairs
directly, sir; and there I found my mistress
on the ground, quite insensible, and she
hasn’t moved a limb since.’</p>

<p>‘Good heavens!’ I inwardly exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
as I ran towards the house, ‘is it possible
she can have been affected by the same
cause?’</p>

<p>I found Janie, as the nurse had said, unconscious;
and it was some time before my
remedies had any effect on her. When
she opened her eyes, and understood the
condition she had been in, she was seized
with such a fit of nervous terror that she
could do nothing but cling to me, and
entreat me to take her away from Rushmere.</p>

<p>Remembering my own experience, I
readily promised her that she should not
sleep another night in the house if she did
not desire it. Soothed by my words, she
gradually calmed down, and was at last
able to relate the circumstance which had
so terrified her.</p>

<p>‘Did you sleep in my room last night,
dear Arthur?’ she asked, curiously.</p>

<p>‘I did not. But since you awoke, you
surely must have been aware of my absence.’</p>

<p>‘I know nothing, and remember nothing,
except the awful horror that overpowered
me. I had gone to sleep very happy last
night, and none of my silly fears, as you
have called them, ever entered my head.
Indeed, I think I was in the midst of some
pleasant dream, when I was awakened by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
the sound of a low sobbing by the bedside.
Oh! such a strange, unearthly sobbing’
(with a shudder). ‘I thought at first it
must be poor little Cissy, who had been
frightened again, and I put out my hand
to her, saying,—“Don’t be afraid, dear.
I am here.” Directly, a hand was placed
in mine—a cold, damp hand, with a death-like,
clayey feel about it that made me
tremble. I knew at once it was not the
child’s hand, and I started up in bed, exclaiming,—“Who
are you?”</p>

<p>‘The room was quite dark, for I had
pinned my shawl across the blind to keep
the moon out of my eyes before I went to
bed, and I could distinguish nothing. Yet
still the cold, damp hand clung to mine,
and seemed to strike the chill of death into
my very bones. When I said, “Who are
you?” something replied to me. I cannot
say it was a voice. It was more like
some one hissing at me through closed
teeth, but I could distinguish the name
“Emily.”</p>

<p>‘I was so frightened, Arthur, I did not
know what to do. I wrenched my hand
away from the dead hand. You were not
there, and I called out loudly. I would
have leaped out of bed, but that I heard
the creeping footsteps, accompanied by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
sobbing breath, go round the room, crying,
“Father, father!”</p>

<p>‘My blood seemed to curdle in my veins.
I could not stir until it was gone. I heard
it leave the room distinctly, although the
door was never opened, and walk upon
the landing as though to go downstairs. I
was still sitting up in bed listening—listening—only
waiting till the dreadful thing
had quite gone away, to seek your presence,
when I heard a heavy step clumping downstairs,
then the report of a gun. I don’t
know <i>what</i> I thought. I remember nothing
that followed; but I suppose I jumped
out of bed with the intention of finding
you, and fainted before I could reach the
dressing-room. Oh, Arthur! what was it?
What is it that haunts this house, and
makes even the sunshine look as gloomy
as night? Oh, take us away from it, or
I am sure that something terrible will
happen!’</p>

<p>‘I <i>will</i> take you away from it, my dear.
We will none of us sleep another night
beneath its roof. What curse hangs over
it, I cannot tell; but whether the strange
sounds we have heard proceed from natural
or supernatural causes, they alike render
Rushmere no home for us. We will go to
the hotel at —— this very day, Janie, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
deliver up the keys of Rushmere again to
Messrs Quibble &amp; Lye.’</p>

<p>I then related to her my own experience,
and that of Dawson; and though she
trembled a little whilst listening to me, the
idea of leaving the place before nightfall
rendered the heavy fear less alarming than
it would otherwise have been.</p>

<p>The servants, upon learning the resolution
we had arrived at, were only too ready
to help us to carry it out. Our personal
possessions were packed in an incredibly
short time, and we sat down that evening
to a comfortable family dinner in the good
old-fashioned inn at ——. As soon as the
meal was concluded, and the children sent
to bed, I said to my wife,—</p>

<p>‘Janie, I am going to ring for the landlord,
to see if he can throw any light on
the cause of our experiences. I never told
you that, when we came to this inn to try
for a nurse to supply Mary’s place, he
informed me that nobody from his countryside
would live at Rushmere; and asked
me, in a manner which assured me he could
have said more if he had chosen, if we had
not heard anything whilst there. I laughed
at the question then, but I do not feel so
disposed to laugh at it now; and I am
going to beg him to tell me all he may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
know. If nothing more, his story may
form the stratum of a curious psychological
study. Would you like to be present at
our interview?’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, Arthur; I have quite recovered
my nerves since I’ve lost sight of Rushmere,
and I feel even curious to learn all
I can upon the subject. That poor, sobbing
voice that whispered “Emily”—I
shall not forget its sound to my dying day.’</p>

<p>‘Ring the bell, dear, and let us ask if
the landlord is at leisure. To my mind,
your experience of the details of this little
tragedy appears the most interesting of
all.’</p>

<p>The landlord, a Mr Browser, entered at
once; and as soon as he heard my request,
made himself completely at home with us.</p>

<p>‘After the little rebuff you gave me
t’other day, I shouldn’t have ventured to
say nothing, sir; but when I see your
family getting out of the fly this afternoon,
I says to Mrs Browser, “If that don’t
mean that they can’t stand Rushmere
another night, I’m a pumpkin.” And I
suppose, now, it did mean it, sir?’</p>

<p>‘You are quite right, Mr Browser. The
noises and voices about the house have
become so intolerable, that it is quite impossible
I can keep my family there. Still,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
I must tell you that, though I have been
unable to account for the disturbances, I
do not necessarily believe they are attributable
to spirits. It is because I do not
believe so that I wish to hear all you may
be able to tell us, in order, if possible, to
find a reason for what appears at present
to be unreasonable.’</p>

<p>‘Well, sir, you shall hear, as you say, all
we have to tell you, and then you can
believe what you like. But it ain’t I as
can relate the story, sir. Mrs Browser
knows a deal more than I do; and with
your leave, and that of this good lady here,
I’ll call her to give you the history of
Rushmere.’</p>

<p>At this information, we displayed an
amount of interest that resulted in a hasty
summons for Mrs Browser. She was a fat,
fair woman, of middle age, with ruddy
cheeks, and a clear blue eye—not at all
like a creature haunted by her own weak
imagination, or who would be likely to
mistake a shadow for a substance. Her
appearance inspired me with confidence.
I trusted that her relation might furnish
me with some clue to the solution of the
occurrences that had so confounded us.
Safe out of the precincts of Rushmere, and
with the lapse of twelve hours since the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
unaccountable swoon I had been seized
with, my practical virtues were once more
in the ascendant, and I was inclined to
attribute our fright to anything but association
with the marvellous.</p>

<p>‘Be I to tell the story from the beginning,
Browser?’ was the first sentence
that dropped from Mrs Browser’s lips.</p>

<p>Her lord and master nodded an affirmative,
whereupon she began:—</p>

<p>‘When the gentleman as built Rushmere
for his own gratification, sir, died,
the house let well enough. But the place
proved lonely, and there was more than
one attempt at robbery, and people grew
tired of taking it. And above all, the girls
of the village began to refuse to go to service
there. Well, it had been standing
empty for some months, when a gentleman
and his wife came to look after it. Browser
and I—we didn’t own this inn at that time,
you will understand, sir, but kept a general
shop in the village, and were but poorly
off altogether, although we had the post-office
at our place, and did the best business
thereabouts. The key of Rushmere
used always to be left in our keeping, too,
and our boy would go up to show folks
over the house. Well, one damp autumn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
day—I mind the day as if ’twere yesterday,
for Browser had been ailing sadly with the
rheumatics for weeks past, and not able
to lift his hand to his head—this gentleman
and lady, who went by the name of Greenslade,
came for the keys of Rushmere. I
remember thinking Mr Greenslade had a
nasty, curious look about his eyes, and
that his wife seemed a poor, brow-beaten
creature; but that was no business of
mine, and I sent Bill up with them to show
the house. They took it, and entered
on possession at once; and then came
the difficulty about the servants. Not a
soul would enter the place at first. Then
a girl or two tried it, and came away when
their month was up, saying the house was
so lonesome, they couldn’t sleep at nights,
and the master was so queer-spoken and
mannered, they were afraid of him.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t forget to say what he was used
to do at nights,’ here put in the landlord.</p>

<p>‘La, Browser, I’m a-coming to it.
Everything in its time. Well, sir, at last
it came to this, that Mrs Greenslade hadn’t
a creature to help her in anythink, and
down she came to ask if I would go
to them for a few days. I stared; for
there was the shop to be tended, and the
post-office looked after, and I hadn’t been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
used to odd jobs like that. But my husband
said that he could do all that was
wanted in the business; and we were very
hard drove just then, and the lady offered
such liberal pay, he over-persuaded me to
go, if only on trial. So I put my pride in
my pocket, and went out charing. I hadn’t
been at Rushmere many days, sir, before
I found something was very wrong there.
Mr Greenslade hardly ever spoke a word,
but shut himself up in a room all day, or
went mooning about the fields and common,
where he couldn’t meet a soul; and
as for the poor lady, la! my heart bled for
her, she seemed so wretched and broken-down
and hopeless. I used often to say
to her,—</p>

<p>‘“Now, ma’am, do let me cook you a
bit of something nice, for you’ve eaten
nothing since yesterday, and you’ll bring
yourself down to death’s door at this rate.”</p>

<p>‘And she’d answer,—</p>

<p>‘“No, thank you, Mrs Browser: I
couldn’t touch it. I feel sometimes as if
I’d never care to eat or drink again.”</p>

<p>‘And Mr Greenslade, he was just as
bad. They didn’t eat enough to keep a
well-grown child between the two of them.’</p>

<p>‘What-aged people were they?’ I
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>‘Well, sir, I can hardly say; they weren’t
young nor yet old. Mr Greenslade, he
may have been about fifty, and his lady a
year or two younger; but I never took
much count of that. But the gentleman
looked much the oldest of the two, by
reason of a stoop in his shoulders and a
constant cough that seemed to tear his
chest to pieces. I’ve known him shut
himself up in the parlour the whole night
long, coughing away fit to keep the whole
house awake. And his breathing, sir—you
could hear it half a mile off.’</p>

<p>‘He was <i>assmatical</i>, poor man! that’s
where it was,’ interposed Mr Browser.</p>

<p>‘Well, I don’t know what his complaint
was called, Browser; but he made noise
enough over it to wake the dead. But
don’t you go interrupting me no more after
that fashion, or the gentleman and lady
will never understand the half of my story,
and I’m just coming to the cream of it.’</p>

<p>‘I assure you we are deeply interested
in what you are telling us,’ I said, politely.</p>

<p>‘It’s very good of you to compliment
me, sir, but I expect it will make matters
clearer to you by-and-by. You’re not the
first tenants of Rushmere I’ve had to tell
this tale to, I can tell you, and you won’t
be the last, either. One night, when I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
couldn’t sleep for his nasty cough, and lay
awake, wishing to goodness he’d go to bed
like a Christian, I made sure I heard footsteps
in the hall, a-creeping and a-creeping
about like, as though some one was feeling
their way round the house. “It can’t be
the mistress,” I thought, “and maybe it’s
robbers, as have little idea the master’s
shut up in the study.” So I opened the
door quickly, but I could see nothing.’</p>

<p>‘Exactly my own experience,’ I exclaimed.</p>

<p>‘Ah, sir, maybe; but they weren’t the
same footsteps, poor dear. I wish they
had been, and she had the same power to
tread now she had then. The hall was
empty; but at the same time I heard the
master groaning and cursing most awful in
the parlour, and I went into my own room
again, that I mightn’t listen to his wicked
oaths and words. I always hated and distrusted
that man from the beginning. The
next day I mentioned I had heard footsteps,
before ’em both, and the rage Mr
Greenslade put himself into was terrible.
He said no robbers had better break into
his house, or he’d shoot them dead as dogs.
Afterwards his wife came to me and asked
me what sort of footsteps they seemed;
and when I told her, she cried upon my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
neck, and begged me if ever I heard a
woman’s step to say nothing of it to her
husband.</p>

<p>‘“A woman’s step, ma’am,” I replied;
“why, what woman would dare break into
a house?”</p>

<p>‘But she only cried the more, and held
her tongue.</p>

<p>‘But that evening I heard their voices
loud in the parlour, and there was a regular
dispute between them.</p>

<p>‘“If ever she should come, Henry,” Mrs
Greenslade said, “promise me you won’t
speak to her unless you can say words of
pity or of comfort.”</p>

<p>‘“Pity!” he yelled, “what pity has
she had for me? If ever she or any
emissary of hers should dare to set foot
upon these premises, I shall treat them
as house-breakers, and shoot them down
like dogs!”</p>

<p>‘“Oh no! Henry, no!” screamed the
poor woman; “think who she is. Think
of her youth, her temptation, and forgive
her.”</p>

<p>‘“I’ll never forgive her—I’ll never own
her!” the wretch answered loudly; “but
I’ll treat her, or any of the cursed crew she
associates with, as I would treat strangers
who forced their way in to rob me by night.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
’Twill be an evil day for them when they
attempt to set foot in my house.”</p>

<p>‘Well, sir, I must cut this long story
short, or you and your good lady will never
get to bed to-night.</p>

<p>‘The conversation I had overheard made
me feel very uncomfortable, and I was
certain some great misfortune or disgrace
had happened to the parties I was serving;
but I didn’t let it rest upon my mind, till a
few nights after, when I was wakened up
by the same sound of creeping footsteps
along the passage. As I sat up in bed
and listened to them, I heard the master
leave the parlour and go upstairs. At the
same moment something crouched beside my
door, and tried to turn the handle; but it was
locked, and wouldn’t open. I felt very uneasy.
I knew my door stood in the shadow,
and that whoever crouched there must have
been hidden from Mr Greenslade as he
walked across the hall. Presently I heard
his footsteps coming downstairs again, as
though he had forgotten something. He
used to wear such thick boots, sir, you
might hear his step all over the house.
His loaded gun always stood on the first
landing; when he reached there he stopped,
I suppose it was his bad angel made him
stop. Anyway, there was a low cry of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
“Father, father!”—a rush, the report of
the gun, a low groan, and then all was still.</p>

<p>‘La! sir, I trembled so in my bed, you
might have seen it shake under me.’</p>

<p>‘I’ve seen it shake under you many a
time,’ said Browser.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps you would like to tell the lady
and gentleman my exact weight, though I
don’t see what that’s got to do with the
story,’ replied his better half, majestically.</p>

<p>‘I don’t think I should ever have had
the courage to leave my room, sir, unless I
had heard my poor mistress fly down the
staircase, with a loud scream. Then I got
up, and joined her. Oh, it was an awful
sight! There, stretched on the floorcloth,
lay the dead body of a young girl; and my
mistress had fainted dead away across her,
and was covered with the blood that was
pouring from a great hole in her forehead.
On the landing stood my master,
white as a sheet, and shaking like an
aspen leaf.</p>

<p>‘“So, this is your doing!” I cried, angrily.
“You’re a nice man to have charge of a
gun. Do you see what you’ve done?
Killed a poor girl in mistake for a robber,
and nearly killed your wife into the bargain.
Who is this poor murdered young creature?
Do you know her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p>‘“Know her!” he repeated, with a
groan. “Woman, don’t torture me with
your questions. <i>She is my own daughter!</i>”</p>

<p>‘He rushed upstairs as he spoke, and I
was in a nice quandary, left alone with the
two unconscious women. When my poor
mistress woke up again, she wanted me
to fetch a doctor; but it would have
been of no use. She was past all human
help.</p>

<p>‘We carried the corpse upstairs between
us, and laid it gently on the bed. I’ve
often wondered since where the poor mother’s
strength came from, but it was lent
her for the need. Then, sitting close to
me for the remainder of the night, she told
me her story—how the poor girl had led
such an unhappy life with her harsh, ill-tempered
father, that she had been tempted
into a foolish marriage by the first lover
that offered her affection and a peaceful
home.</p>

<p>‘“I always hoped she would come back
to us,” said Mrs Greenslade, “for her husband
had deserted her, leaving her destitute;
and yet, although she knew how to
enter the house unobserved, I dreaded her
doing so, because of her father’s bitter
enmity. Only last night, Mrs Browser, I
awoke from sleep, and fancied I heard a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
sobbing in my room. I whispered, ‘Who
is there?’ and a voice replied, ‘Emily!’
But I thought it was a dream. If I had
known—if I had but known!”</p>

<p>‘She lay so quiet and uncomplaining
on my knee, only moving now and
then, that she frightened me; and when
the morning broke, I tried to shift her,
and said,—</p>

<p>‘“Hadn’t I better go and see after the
master, ma’am?”</p>

<p>‘As I mentioned his name, I could see
the shudder that ran through her frame;
but she motioned me away with her
hand.</p>

<p>‘I went upstairs to a room Mr Greenslade
called his dressing-room, and where
I guessed he’d gone; and you’ll never believe,
sir, the awful sight as met my eyes.
I didn’t get over it for a month—did I,
Browser?’</p>

<p>‘You haven’t got over it to this day,
I’m sometimes thinking, missus.’</p>

<p>‘That means I’m off my head; but if it
wasn’t for my head, I wonder where the
business would go to. No, sir—if you’ll
believe me, when I entered the room, there
was the old man dead as mutton, hanging
from a beam in the ceiling. I gave one
shriek, and down I fell.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>‘I don’t wonder at it,’ cried Janie.</p>

<p>‘Well, ma’am, when I came to again,
all was confusion and misery. We had
the perlice in, and the crowner’s inquest,
and there was such a fuss, you never see.
Some of Mrs Greenslade’s friends came
and fetched her away; but I heard she
didn’t live many months afterwards. As
for myself, I was only too glad to get back
to the shop and my old man, and the first
words I said to him was,—</p>

<p>‘“No more charing for me.”’</p>

<p>‘And now, sir, if I may make so bold,
what do you think of the story?’ demanded
the landlord. ‘Can you put this and that
together now?’</p>

<p>‘It is marvellous!’ I replied. ‘Your wife
has simply repeated the scene which we
have heard enacted a dozen times in Rushmere.
The footsteps were a nightly occurrence.’</p>

<p>‘I heard the voice!’ exclaimed Janie,
‘and it whispered “<i>Emily.</i>”’</p>

<p>‘The handle of my servant’s door was
turned. The report of the gun was as distinct
as possible.’</p>

<p>‘That is what everybody says as goes to
Rushmere, sir. No one can abide the
place since that awful murder was committed
there,’ said Mrs Browser.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>‘And can you account for it in any way,
sir?’ demanded her husband, slyly. ‘Do
you think, now that you’ve heard the
story, that the noises are mortal, or that
it’s the spirits of the dead that causes
them?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know what to think, Browser.
There is a theory that no uttered sound is
ever lost, but drifts as an eddying circle
into space, until in course of time it must
be heard again. Thus our evil words, too
often accompanied by evil deeds, live for
ever, to testify against us in eternity. It
may be that the Universal Father ordains
that some of His guilty children shall expurgate
their crimes by re-acting them
until they become sensible of their enormity;
but this can be but a matter for
speculation. This story leaves us, as such
stories usually do, as perplexed as we were
before. We cannot tell—we probably
never <i>shall</i> tell—what irrefragable laws of
the universe these mysterious circumstances
fulfil; but we know that spirit and matter
alike are in higher hands than ours; and,
whilst nature cannot help trembling when
brought in contact with the supernatural,
we have no need to fear that it will ever
be permitted to work us harm.’</p>

<p>This little analysis was evidently too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
much for Mr and Mrs Browser, who, with
a look of complete mystification on their
countenances, rose from their seats, and
wished us respectfully good-night; leaving
Janie and me to evolve what theories we
chose from the true story of the Invisible
Tenants of Rushmere.</p>

<p class="dropcap">It was five o’clock—five o’clock
on a dull November afternoon—as
I, Elizabeth Lacy, the
wretched companion of Lady
Cunningham, of Northampton Lodge, in
the town of Rockledge, stood gazing from
the dining-room windows at the grey curtain
of fog which was slowly but surely
rising between my vision and all outward
things, and thinking how like it was in
colour and feeling and appearance to my
own sad life. I have said that I was the
‘wretched’ companion of Lady Cunningham:
is it very ungrateful of me to
have written down that word? I think
not; for if a wearisome seclusion and continual
servitude have power to make a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
young life miserable, mine had fairly
earned its title to be called so. I had
withered in the cold and dispiriting atmosphere
of Northampton Lodge for four
years past, and had only been prevented
rupturing my chains by the knowledge
that I had no alternative but to rush from
one state of bondage to another. To
attend upon old ladies like an upper
servant—to write their letters, carry their
shawls, and wait upon them as they moved
from room to room—this was to be my lot
through life; and if I ever dreamed that
a brighter one might intervene, the vision
was too faint and idealistic to gild the
stern realities which were no dreams.</p>

<p>I daresay there are plenty of people in
this world more miserable than I: indeed,
I knew it for a fact even at the time of
which I speak; and the few friends I
possessed were never tired of telling me
that I was better off than many, and that
I should strive to look on the bright side
of things, and to thank heaven who had
provided me with a safe and respectable
home, when I might have been upon the
parish. Did not Job have friends to
console him in his trouble? Do not we
all find in the day of our distress that,
whatever else fails, good advice is always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
forthcoming? Well! perhaps I <i>was</i> ungrateful:
at all events, I was young and
headstrong, and good advice irritated and
worried, instead of making me any better.
I knew that I was warmly clothed, whilst
beggars stood shivering at the corner of
the streets, and that beneath the care of
Lady Cunningham no harm could happen
to me, whilst women younger than myself
broke God’s holy laws to put bread in their
mouths. And yet, and yet, so perverse is
human nature, and so perverse was mine
above all others, that, engaged on my
monotonous round of duty, I often envied
the beggars their liberty and their rags;
and even sometimes wished that I had not
been reared so honestly, and had the
courage to be less respectable and more
free. Perhaps one reason why my life
chafed me so fearfully, was because I had
not been brought up to it. Five years
before, I had been the child of parents in
good circumstances, and loved and made
much of, as only daughters generally are.
My father, who held the comfortable living
of Fairmead in Dorsetshire, had always
managed to keep up the household of a
gentleman, and my poor delicate mother
and myself had enjoyed every luxury consistent
with our station in life. She had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
had her flower-garden and her poultry and
her pony-chair, and I my pets and my
piano and—my lover. Ah! as I stood at
the wire-blinded windows of Lady Cunningham’s
dining-room that sad November
afternoon, and recalled these things, I
knew by the pang which assailed me at
the thought of Bruce Armytage, which loss
of them all had affected me most. My
father and mother, who from my youth up
had so tenderly loved and guarded me,
were in their graves, and with them had
vanished all the luxuries and possessions
of my early days. But though I stood
there a penniless orphan, with no joy in
my present and very little hope in my
future, the tears had not rushed to my eyes
until my memory had rested on Bruce
Armytage; and then they fell so thickly
that they nearly blinded me; for mingled
with his memory came shame as well as
regret, and to a woman perhaps shame is
the harder feeling of the two. His conduct
had been so very strange, so marvellously
strange and unaccountable to me,
that to that day I had found no clue to it.
When he first came down and took lodgings
in Fairmead—for the purpose of studying
to pass his examination for the law, he
said—he had seemed so very, very fond of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
me that our engagement followed on the
avowal of his love as a matter of course.
But then his family interfered; they thought,
perhaps, that he ought to marry some one
higher than myself, though my father was
a gentleman, and no man can be more; at
any rate, <i>his</i> father wrote to say that Bruce
was far too young (his age was then just
twenty) to fix upon his choice for life, and
that no regular engagement must be made
between us until he returned from the two
years’ foreign tour he was about to make.
My father and mother said that old Mr
Armytage was right, and that in two years’
time both I and my lover would be better
able to form an opinion on so serious a
matter. Bruce and I declared it was all
nonsense, that fifty years of separation
could make no difference to us, and that
what we felt then, we should feel to our
lives’ end. And they smiled, the old
people, whilst our young hearts were being
tortured, and talked about the evanescence
of youthful feelings, whilst we drank our
first draught of this world’s bitterness.
How seldom can old people sympathise
with the young! How soon they become
accustomed to the cold neutral tints of
middle age, and forget even the appearance
of the warm fires of youth at which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
they lighted those passions which time
has reduced to ashes! It was so with my
parents: they were not unkind, but they
were unsympathetic; they rather hoped,
upon the whole, that I should forget Bruce
Armytage; and, in order to accomplish
their end, they pretended to believe it.
But he went, with the most passionate
protestations upon his lips, that as soon as
he returned to England, no earthly power
should keep us separate; and he never
came back to me again! My father and
mother had died rather suddenly, and
within a few months of each other; our
home had been broken up, and at the age
of nineteen I had been sent forth upon the
world to earn my own living; and, at the
age of three-and-twenty, I was at the same
trade, neither richer nor poorer than at first,
but with all my faith in the constancy and
honour of mankind broken and destroyed;
for Bruce Armytage had never found me
out, or, as far as I knew, inquired after me.
His family had permitted me to leave
Fairmead and enter on my solitary career
without a word of remonstrance or regret;
since which time I had had no communication
with them, though at that period
my pride would not have forbidden my
sending an account of my trouble to Bruce,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
believing that he cared for me. Correspondence
between us during his foreign
tour had been strictly prohibited, and I
had no means of ascertaining his address.
For a while I had expected he would
write or come to me; but that hope had
long died out, and the only feeling I had
left for him was contempt—contempt for
his fickleness and vacillation, or the pusillanimity
which could permit him to give up
the woman he had sworn to marry because
his father ordered him to do so. No!
filial obedience carries very little weight
with the heart that is pitted against it; and
as I thought of it and him, I bit my lip,
dashed my hand across my eyes, and hoped
the day might yet come when I should be
able to show Bruce Armytage how greatly
I despised him.</p>

<p>At this juncture the housemaid came
bustling into the room with a little note
for me—a dear little cocked-hat note—which
seemed to speak of something
pleasant, and at the writer of which I
had no need to guess, for I had but one
friend in Rockledge who ever sent such
notes to me.</p>

<p>‘Waiting for an answer,’ said the bearer
curtly; and I tore it open and devoured
its contents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dear Lizzie</span>,—I think you will be
<i>very much</i> surprised to hear that your
little friend Amy is engaged to be married!
However, it is quite true, although the
business was only settled this morning;
and the young gentleman has promised
to spend the evening with us, and to bring
a cousin whom he is anxious to introduce.
Will you come and take tea with us also?
The doctor has only just told me that
Lady Cunningham dines out to-night, or
I should have sent before. Do come,
Lizzie. Amy is crazy to see you and tell
you all her secrets, and you know that you
are always sure of a welcome from your
affectionate friend,</p>

<p class="right">
‘<span class="smcap">Mary Rodwell</span>.’<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>The perusal of this little epistle threw me
into a perfect whirl of excitement and delight,
which would have appeared extraordinary
to any one who had not been acquainted
with the maddening monotony of my daily
existence. These Rodwells, the family of
the good old doctor who attended Lady
Cunningham, were my only friends in
Rockledge, the only people with whom I
ever caught a glimpse of a happy domestic
life, such as had been once my own. To
spend the evening at their large, old-fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
house, which rang from basement
to attic with the sound of happy
voices, was the only dissipation by which
my days were ever varied, and a relaxation
all the more precious because, on account
of Lady Cunningham’s requirements, it
came so rarely to me. And on the afternoon
in question, when I had allowed myself
to become absorbed by fanciful thought,
the cordial and unexpected invitation
warmed my chilled spirits like a draught
of generous wine. All things seemed
changed for me: I no longer saw the grey
fog nor remembered my mournful past,
but in their stead pictured to myself the
brightly-lighted, crimson-curtained room
at Dr Rodwell’s house, and heard the
ringing laughter and merry jests of his
many boys and girls. In a moment I had
shaken off my despondency—my eyes
sparkled, my heart beat: I was in a flutter
of anticipation at the pleasure in store for
me.</p>

<p>‘Is there any answer, miss?’ demanded
the housemaid, who had been waiting
whilst I read my note.</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes; I will go, of course. Say I
will be there in half-an-hour,’ I replied, for
my evening, in consequence of Lady Cunningham’s
absence, was at my own disposal.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
‘And, Mary, please bring me up a jug of
hot water; I am going to take tea with
Mrs Rodwell.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I’m very glad of it, miss; it’s a
shame you shouldn’t have a holiday oftener
than you do,’ returned my sympathising
hearer as she departed with my answer.</p>

<p>I must say that, during my years of
servitude, I had nothing to complain of
respecting the treatment I received from
the hands of servants. I have read of
needy companions and governesses being
cruelly insulted and trampled on by their
inferiors; I never was. From the first
they saw I was a gentlewoman, and to the
last they treated me as such.</p>

<p>With a hasty vote of thanks to Mary
for her kind speech, I ran upstairs to my
own bedroom to make the few preparations
needful for my visit. I knew that Mrs
Rodwell would not desire me to dress;
but to arrange my hair anew with a blue
ribbon woven in it, and to change my dark
merino body for a clear muslin Garibaldi,
made me look fresh and smart, without
taking up too much of the precious time I
had to spend at her house. Besides, were
there not to be some gentlemen present?
At that thought my mind reverted to the
wonderful news of Amy’s engagement, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
I could scarcely proceed with my toilet for
thinking of it. Little Amy! younger by
five years than myself, who had always
appeared so shy and modest and retiring—was
it possible she could have had a
lover without my knowing it? And now
to be actually engaged! going to be married
at her age! It almost seemed incredible,
until I remembered with a sudden sigh
that I had been no older myself when
Bruce Armytage proposed to me, and had
been able to keep my secret very well until
the necessity for doing so was over.</p>

<p>But I would not let such thoughts
engross me now, for I had no wish to
carry a long face to Mrs Rodwell’s house;
and so I hurried on the remainder of my
things, and wrapping myself up warmly
in a dark cloak, hurried bravely out into
the evening air. It was then six o’clock,
and the fog was denser than before; but
what cared I for outer dulness any longer?
My imagination ran on before me, vividly
picturing the cheerful scene in which I
should so soon mingle, and my feet
tripped after it joyous as my heart. I
had not far to go, and my eagerness
shortened the way; so that in a few
minutes I was rapping at Dr Rodwell’s
hall door and scraping my feet upon his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
scraper. How quickly it was opened
by little Amy herself! And what a mixture
of bashfulness, pleasure, and self-importance
was in her blushing face as
I threw my arms around her neck and
warmly congratulated her.</p>

<p>‘Come upstairs, Lizzie,’ she entreated in
a whisper; ‘come up and take off your
things, and I’ll tell you all about it.’</p>

<p>We were soon in her own room—that
cosy room in which she and her younger
sister Mattie slept, and which bore so
many evidences of their mother’s tender
care and thought for them.</p>

<p>‘And so you are really engaged to
be married, Amy?’ I exclaimed as the
door closed behind us. ‘That was a very
astounding piece of intelligence to me,
who had never heard the faintest whisper
of such a thing before.’</p>

<p>‘You forget you have not been near
us for a month,’ she answered, laughing;
‘but the truth is, Lizzie, it was all so
uncertain till this morning that mamma
said it would be very unwise to mention
it to anybody; so that you were the first
recipient of the news, after all.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I suppose I must be satisfied
with that; and when did you meet him,
Amy?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>‘Last month, up in London, while I was
staying with my Aunt Charlesworth.’</p>

<p>‘And is it a settled thing, then?’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes! His parents have consented,
and are coming to Rockledge on purpose
to call on us. And—and—<i>he</i> came down
this morning to tell papa; and I believe
we are to be married in the spring.’</p>

<p>‘So soon?’ I ejaculated, thinking how
easily some people’s courtships ran.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ replied Amy, blushing; ‘and he
is here this evening, you know, with his
cousin, who is staying at Rockledge with
him. He talked so much about this
cousin, but oh! he is not <i>half</i> so nice-looking
as himself; and—and—I hope
you will like him, Lizzie dear,’ kissing me
affectionately as she spoke, ‘for I have
told him so much about you.’</p>

<p>‘I am sure I shall, Amy,’ I replied as I
returned her caress; we were on the
staircase at the time, descending to the
dining-room. ‘I assure you I am quite
impatient to see your hero. By-the-bye,
dear, what is his name?’</p>

<p>‘Armytage.’ And then, seeing my
blank look of amazement, she repeated
it—‘Armytage. Have you never heard
the name before? I think it’s such a
pretty one. Amy Armytage,’ she whispered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
finally in my ear, as, laughing
merrily, she pushed me before her into
the dining-room.</p>

<p>It was all done so suddenly that I had
no time to think about it, for before the
echo of her words had died away, I was in
the midst of the family group, being
warmly kissed by Mrs Rodwell, and
Mattie, and Nelly, and Lotty, and shaken
hands with by the dear, kind old doctor,
and his rough school-boys.</p>

<p>‘Well, Lizzie dear,’ exclaimed my
motherly hostess, as she claimed me for
a second embrace, ‘this is quite an unexpected
treat, to have you here to-night;
I thought we were never going to see
you again. But you look pale, my child;
I am afraid you are kept too much in
the house. Doctor, what have you been
about, not to take better care of Lizzie?
You should give her a tonic, or speak to
Lady Cunningham on the subject.’</p>

<p>But the good old doctor stuck both his
fingers into his ears.</p>

<p>‘Now, I’m not going to have any
talk about pale looks or physic bottles to-night,’
he said; ‘the time for doctoring
to-day is over. Miss Lizzie, you just
come and sit between Tom and me,
and we’ll give you something that will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
beat all the tonics that were ever invented.
Here, Mattie, pass the scones
and oatcakes down this way, will you?
If you children think you are going to keep
all the good things up at your end of the
table, you are very much mistaken,’ and
with no gentle touch my hospitable friend
nearly pulled me down into his own lap.</p>

<p>‘Now, doctor!’ exclaimed Mrs Rodwell,
with an affectation of annoyance,
‘I will not have you treat my guests in
this way. Lizzie has come to see <i>me</i>, not
<i>you</i>, and she sits by no side but mine.
Besides, you have not even given me
time to introduce the gentlemen to her.
Lizzie, my dear, we must all be friends
here this evening. Mr Bruce Armytage,
Mr Frederick Armytage—Miss Lacy.
And now, doctor, we’ll go to tea as soon
as you please.’</p>

<p>I had known from the moment of my
entering the room that there were strangers
in it, but I had not dared to glance their
way. Amy’s announcement of her lover’s
name had come too unexpectedly to permit
me to form any fixed idea upon the
subject, excepting that it was the same as
mine had borne, and yet, when Mrs Rodwell
repeated it with the familiar prefix,
strange to say, I seemed to hear it with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
no second shock, but to have known the
bitter truth all along.</p>

<p>Not so, however, Bruce Armytage; for
Mrs Rodwell’s introduction was scarcely
concluded before I heard his voice (unforgotten
through the lapse of years) exclaim,
‘Miss Lacy!’ in a tone of surprise,
which could not but be patent to all.</p>

<p>Cold and pulseless as I had felt before,
the mere tones of his voice sent the blood
rushing from my heart to my head, till the
room and the tea-table and the group of
living figures swam before my dazzled
eyes. I felt my weakness, but I determined
all the more that no one else should
guess at it, and mentally stamped upon
my heart to make it steady against the
moment when its energies should be required.</p>

<p>‘You have met Mr Armytage before,
Lizzie?’ said Mrs Rodwell, with a pleasant
astonishment.</p>

<p>Then I lifted my eyes and looked at
him. Good God! What is the vital force
of this feeling, called love, which Thou
hast given to us, far oftener to prove a
curse than a blessing, that after years of
separation, coldness, and neglect, it has
the strength to spring up again, warm and
passionate as ever, at the sight of a face,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
the tone of a voice, or the touch of a hand?
Has nothing the power to trample life out
of it? Will it always revive when we
think it most dead, and turn its pale mutilated
features up to the glare of day?
Shall our mortal dust, even when coffined
in the mould, stir and groan and vainly
strive to make itself heard, as the step of
one whom we have loved passes sorrowfully
over the fresh grass beneath which
we lie?</p>

<p>I lifted up my eyes, and looked upon
Bruce Armytage, to be able to say truly
if I had met him before. Yes, it was he,
but little altered during our five years of
separation, excepting that he had passed
from a boy to a man. He coloured vividly
beneath my steady gaze; for a moment I
thought he was about to seize my hand,
but my eyes forbade him, and he shrank
backward.</p>

<p>‘Mr Armytage and I <i>have</i> met before,’
I said, with a marvellous quietness, in
answer to Mrs Rodwell’s previous question—‘when
I was living in my old home
at Fairmead; but that is so many years
ago that we are nothing but strangers to
each other now.’</p>

<p>At these words any purpose which he
might have entertained of claiming me as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
an old acquaintance evidently died out of
Bruce Armytage’s mind; for, retreating
a few paces, he bowed coldly to me, and
took a seat, where his proper place now
was, by Amy’s side.</p>

<p>‘Oh, not strangers, my dear—oh no!’
exclaimed Mrs Rodwell, who had taken
my answer in its literal sense. ‘You must
all be friends together here, you know, if
it is only for Amy’s sake. Mr Frederick
Armytage, will you be so kind as to pass
the muffins up this way? Thank you!
Now, Lizzie, my dear, you must make a
good tea.’</p>

<p>I sat down between my host and hostess,
triumphant on the subject of the manner
in which I had acquitted myself, and feeling
strong enough for any future trial;
but before many minutes had elapsed I
was overtaken by a sickly and oppressive
sensation for which I was quite unable to
account. The hot flush which had risen
to my face whilst speaking to Bruce Armytage
died away, leaving a cold, leaden
weight upon my breast instead; my pulses
ceased their quick leap and took to trembling;
the rich dainties which the doctor
and his wife heaped upon my plate nauseated
me even to contemplate; and a
whirring confusion commenced in my head,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
which obliged me to rally all my forces
before I could answer a simple question.
The noise and laughter of the tea-table
seemed to increase every minute; and if
one might judge from the incessant giggling
of Amy, Mattie, Nelly, and Lotty,
the two gentlemen at the other end were
making themselves very agreeable. I tried
to eat; I tried to force the buttered toast
and plum cake and rich preserves down
my throat, but there was something there
which utterly prevented my swallowing
them.</p>

<p>‘Lizzie, my dear, are you not well?’
inquired Mrs Rodwell, presently. The
friendly interrogation saved me. I had
just been relapsing into a state of weakness
which might have resulted in hysteria:
her words recalled me to myself. Should
all the table know that I was grieving?
Or rather should he—he who had deserted
me, and had forsworn himself, who now
sat by the side of his newly betrothed—guess
that his presence had the slightest
power to affect me? Good heavens!
where was my pride? where the contempt
which I had hoped to have an opportunity
of showing for him? I almost sprang
from my chair at the thought.</p>

<p>‘Not well, dear Mrs Rodwell!’ I exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
speaking as fast and as shrilly
as people generally do under the circumstances;
‘why, what can make you think
so? I never felt better in my life. But,
really, you do so oppress me with good
things that it is quite impossible I can do
justice to them all, and talk at the same
time. No, doctor, not another piece of cake.
I couldn’t, really; thank you all the same.
You know there is a limit to all things,
though you never seem to think so where
I am concerned.’</p>

<p>Whilst my voice thus rang out, harshly
and unnaturally, across the table, I felt
the dark eyes of Bruce Armytage were
regarding me from the other end, and
I wished I had the courage to stare
him down, but I had not. By-and-by,
however, when he was again engaged in
conversation, I tried to let my eyes rove
in his direction, as though I were an uninterested
hearer, but the moment that
they reached him, he raised his own as if
by intuition, and my lids dropped again.
I hated myself for this indecision, though
I felt it was but nervousness, and that
were we alone together but for five
minutes I should have strength of mind
to look him in the face, and tell him what
I thought of his behaviour. As it was,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
however, it was a great relief to me when
the doctor gave the order to march, and
the whole party adjourned to the drawing-room.
As soon as we had entered it, Amy
left her lover’s side and flew to mine.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Lizzie,’ she whispered as we sat
in a corner together, ‘do tell me what you
think of him! I am dying to hear. Is he
not very handsome?’</p>

<p>‘Very handsome,’ I answered with closed
lips.</p>

<p>‘Much better looking than his cousin?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, certainly; there is no comparison
between them,’ which was true, inasmuch
as Frederick Armytage, with his fair hair
and blue eyes, was a washed-out, sickly-looking
creature by the side of his dark,
stalwart cousin Bruce.</p>

<p>‘I knew you would say so, Lizzie; I
was sure you would agree with me. But
just fancy your having met Bruce before!
Where was it, and when? I couldn’t ask
you a lot of questions at tea-time, but you
made me so curious.’</p>

<p>‘Amy,’ I said suddenly, for I felt this
was a subject on which she must not be
inquisitive, ‘when I knew Mr Bruce Armytage,
I was living at home with my
dear father and mother at Fairmead, and
you must be aware that an allusion to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
those days cannot be a pleasant allusion
to me. So, please, like a dear girl, don’t
ask me any more questions about it, or let
me remember that I ever saw your friend
before I met him here to-night.’</p>

<p>‘I won’t,’ said Amy, submissively. ‘Poor,
dear Lizzie!’ and she stroked my hand
with her soft little palm.</p>

<p>‘And do not mention me to him, either.
Our acquaintance was but a brief one: he
can have no interest left in the matter.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, but he has though, Lizzie,’ with a
shy upward glance. ‘He was talking
about you all tea-time; his cousin and I
thought he would never stop. He asked
where you were, and what you were doing,
and seemed so sorry when I told him of
Lady Cunningham, and what a cross old
thing she is, and said several times that he
could not get over the surprise of having
met you here to-night.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed! He has a more retentive
memory than I have; you can tell him
so next time he speaks of me.’ I answered
so haughtily that little Amy looked timidly
up in my face, and I remembered suddenly
that I was speaking of her lover. ‘There
is your mamma beckoning to you, Amy;
and Mattie and Tom are clearing away the
chairs and tables. I suppose they want a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
dance. Tell them I shall be charmed to
play for them;’ and then, seeing that
Bruce Armytage was crossing the room
with a view to seeking Amy, I quickly
left my seat, and taking possession of the
music-stool, commenced to rattle off a polka.
Soon they were all busily engaged in dancing,
and the noise occasioned by their feet
and voices almost prevented my hearing
the conversation which Mrs Rodwell, who
had taken up a station with her knitting
close to the piano, addressed to me.</p>

<p>‘You were very much surprised to hear
our news, Lizzie, I’m sure,’ she began, as
she bent toward my ear.</p>

<p>‘Very much surprised, Mrs Rodwell—never
more so.’</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ with a sigh, ‘dear Amy is full
young—only eighteen last October, you
know, Lizzie; but I think she’ll be happy.
I’m sure I trust so. He is a very steady
young man, and they are to live in Rockledge,
which is a great comfort to me.’</p>

<p>‘In Rockledge!’ Was I to undergo
the pain of continual intercourse with him,
or the alternative of quitting my present
situation? ‘Did I hear you rightly, Mrs
Rodwell?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, my dear. His papa, who appears
to be a very pleasant old gentleman, has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
decided to set him up in an office here,
that Amy may not be separated from her
family. So thoughtful of him, Lizzie, is it
not?’</p>

<p>‘Very!’ I remembered the pleasant old
gentleman’s conduct on a similar occasion
more immediately concerning myself, and
could scarcely trust my voice to answer her.</p>

<p>‘You have heard that Mr Armytage is
in the law, have you not?’ I nodded my
head: I had heard it. ‘A nice profession—so
gentlemanly; and he is a fine-looking
young man too; don’t you think so? I
have heard that some people prefer his
cousin’s looks to his; but beauty is such a
matter of taste, and Amy is quite satisfied
on the subject. You may stop playing
now, my dear, for they have all done dancing.
Nelly, child, how hot you are! Come
away at once from the draught of the
door.’</p>

<p>‘A waltz, a waltz, Lizzie!’ they all
shouted as they surrounded the piano.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps Miss Lacy is tired,’ suggested
the deep voice of Bruce Armytage. I had
been going to plead for a brief respite, but
at that sound the desire for repose fled,
and without a look in his direction I returned
to the instrument and began to play
the dance they had asked for. But I had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
not been so occupied long before I became
aware that some one amongst them continued
to hover about the piano, and felt
by intuition that it was Bruce Armytage.
At that discovery my fingers flew faster
and more gaily, and I regarded the notes
before me with a fixed smile, whilst, in
order to keep up my courage, I kept repeating
to myself: ‘He deserted me: he
left me for no fault of mine. My father
and mother died, and he never came near
me in my sorrow. He is fickle, base, dishonourable—unworthy
of regard.’ I tried
to set the notes of the waltz that I was
playing to the words, ‘Fickle, base, dishonourable!’
but they refused to be so
matched, and only seemed to repeat instead,
‘I loved him, I loved him, I loved
him!’ and then a blurred mist came before
my eyes, and I had to play from memory;
for Bruce Armytage had taken up his
station at the back of the piano and was
looking me full in the face.</p>

<p>‘It is a long time since we met, Miss
Lacy,’ he remarked presently, but in so
low a voice that had my hearing not been
sharpened by anger at his daring to address
me, I do not think I should have caught
the words.</p>

<p>‘Do you think so?’ I answered carelessly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
for I felt that I must say something.</p>

<p>‘How can you ask? Have the last five
years passed so pleasantly as to leave no
evidence of the flight of time?’</p>

<p>‘Considering,’ I replied, panting with indignation
at what appeared to me such
thorough indifference to my feelings, ‘considering,
Mr Armytage, that during the
years you speak of I have lost both my
dear parents, I should think you might
have spared me the allusion.’</p>

<p>‘Forgive me. I did not mean to wound
you. But if the loss of your parents is the
only loss you have to regret during those
five years, you are happier than some,
Miss Lacy. Death is natural, but there
are griefs (the loss of love and hope, for
instance) almost too unnatural to be borne.’</p>

<p>How dared he, how dared he—he who
had treated me in so cruel and unnatural a
manner himself, who had but just plighted
his faith afresh to my friend—quietly stand
there, looking me in the face with his dark,
searching eyes, and taunt me with the
barrenness of the life which he had made
sterile? Much as I had loved him—much
as I feared I loved him still—I could have
stood up at that moment and denounced
him to them all as a traitor and a coward.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
But I thought of Amy, dear little innocent,
confiding Amy, and I was silent.</p>

<p>‘<i>I</i> have not lost them,’ I answered
him, quietly. ‘Therefore I cannot sympathise
with your allusion. The death of
my dear parents was more than sufficient
trouble for me; all else of solace that this
world can give me is mine.’</p>

<p>‘Do you mean to tell me—’ he commenced
quickly.</p>

<p>‘I mean to tell nothing,’ I replied in the
same cold tones. ‘I am not in the habit
of discussing my private affairs with strangers.
Had you not better go to Amy? I
see that she is sitting out this dance.’</p>

<p>Upon which he gravely inclined his head
in acquiescence, and left me to myself.</p>

<p>‘Lizzie, Lizzie, how fast you have been
playing! We are all out of breath,’ exclaimed
Mattie, as she and Tom danced up
to my side. ‘Get up, there’s a good girl,
and let me take your place; we are going
to have a game of “Magical Music.” Tom,
will you go out first? That’s right; now,
girls, what shall we hide? Oh, papa’s
keys; they will do, and then, if he wants
them, he will take quite an interest in
coming and joining in the game himself.’</p>

<p>I resigned my seat, and stole a hasty
glance at the other end of the room. Mrs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
Rodwell was busily engaged upon her
knitting, and Bruce was sitting on an ottoman
close by Amy’s side; so, gasping for
fresh air and one moment’s solitude, and
unperceived by the laughing group of children,
I left the apartment and ran hastily
up to the bedroom which I had first entered.
The gas was lighted there, and the fire
burned warmly on the hearth, but in my
present state of feeling neither warmth nor
light was what I most desired. I felt as
though I were choking—as though, if no
relief were at hand, I must scream aloud,
or dash my head against the wall, for my
nerves were overstrung, and the demon of
hysteria was gaining strength with every
minute, and I almost feared would win the
victory. But pride came to my assistance—that
mighty supporter of human weakness—and
flying to the window, I raised
the sash and leaned my head out of it,
drinking in deep draughts of the foggy
night air. And as I did so, watching the
bustle in the street below, and the calm
stars in the sky above, I felt strength return
to me,—strength, not to avoid suffering,
but to suffer in patience. The tears
rose to my eyes and fell quietly over my
cheeks, and as they fell they seemed to dissolve
the hard, dry lump which had settled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
in my throat and threatened to deprive me
of breath. I thought of Bruce Armytage
as I had known him in the past, and my
tears fell fast for the loss I had sustained
in him; but I thought of him also as I saw
him in the present, and pride and jealousy
made me dash them from my eyes, and
resolve that if I died—yes, if I died of
grief and love and longing combined—he
should never have the gratification of knowing
that I had retained one particle of my
old affection for him. With which intent I
hurried on my walking things, determined
not to expose myself any longer to the
danger of betrayal; but before I had
finished doing so, Mrs Rodwell was in the
room, all anxiety to know what had occasioned
my sudden absence.</p>

<p>‘What is the matter, Lizzie? Did you
feel the heat of the room? Why, my dear
child, you are never going! It is only just
nine o’clock.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, dear Mrs Rodwell, I think I had
better do so. Lady Cunningham will not
be late to-night, and you know how particular
she is about my being home before
her. Please let me go.’</p>

<p>‘Well, dear, it must not be so long again
before we see you. We must try and get up
a few parties this winter, as it will be Amy’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
last in the home circle. And mind, Lizzie,
you are to be one of her bridesmaids; she
insists upon it.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! She is very kind, as you all are,
but we will talk of that when the time
comes. Good-night, dear Mrs Rodwell.
Kiss the girls for me. I won’t go into the
drawing-room, such a figure as I am.’</p>

<p>But Mrs Rodwell accompanied me down
the stairs, conversing as she went.</p>

<p>‘I am sorry the doctor is from home,
my dear; he would have seen you round
to Northampton Lodge; but he is never
to be depended on from one hour to
another, you know.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, it is of no consequence, Mrs Rodwell;
I am used to going alone.’</p>

<p>‘But I don’t half like your doing it,
Lizzie: the night is so very dark, and—’</p>

<p>‘Allow me to have the pleasure of
accompanying Miss Lacy, Mrs Rodwell,’
said the voice of Bruce Armytage. We
had reached the drawing-room floor by
that time, and he stood on the threshold
of the open door.</p>

<p>‘No, no!’ I exclaimed, as I shrank
backward; ‘I do not desire it—I would
rather go alone;’ and with a hasty kiss
on Mrs Rodwell’s cheek, I ran down the
remaining stairs and out at the hall door.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
The wind was blowing fresh and cold as
I turned into the open air, and the night
was very dark, but I thought of nothing
but his offer to accompany me, and I
hurried onward. Did he wish to add
insult to injury?</p>

<p>But I had not gone far when I heard
the sound of footsteps running after me;
and I had hardly realised it was indeed
himself before he was by my side, apologising
for his presence by the excuse that
Mrs Rodwell had desired him to overtake
me and see me home. Would I forgive
what might otherwise seem an intrusion
to me? I was too indignant to vouchsafe
him any answer.</p>

<p>We walked on in silence side by side
for several minutes, I with my head bent
down and holding my thick cloak around
me, and he vainly endeavouring to look
me in the face. At last, as though making
a great effort, he cleared his throat, and
said,—</p>

<p>‘I suppose, after the manner in which
you spoke to me at the piano this evening,
my pride ought to forbid my attempting
any further explanation with you, but in
this case I have one feeling more powerful
than pride, Miss Lacy, and I must ask
you what you meant by saying that all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
that this world could give of solace was
yours?’</p>

<p>‘I meant what I said,’ I answered abruptly,
‘or rather, that I require no pity
from you or any other stranger. Our
paths in life are widely enough divided
now: let each walk in his own track,
without interfering with the other.’</p>

<p>‘That is easier said than done, perhaps,’
he replied; ‘it is difficult in this world for
people to forget what they have been.’</p>

<p>‘It does not appear so to me.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, perhaps you are differently, more
happily, constituted than most. They told
me so long ago, though I did not believe
them. Will you consider an old friend
impertinent for asking if that from which
you derive your solace now is the same
from which you derived it then? and if
so, why I still find you unsettled in
life?’</p>

<p>‘You are speaking in riddles,’ I replied.
‘I do not understand you.’</p>

<p>‘Your present engagement—is it the
same which separated us? Do not be
afraid to tell me the truth, Lizzie. I have
borne a good deal in my lifetime, and am
proof against suffering.’</p>

<p>His voice was so tender and kind, so
much like the voice which I remembered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
in the old days of our love, that it won
me to listen to him quietly.</p>

<p>‘My engagement!’ I echoed in surprise.
‘What are you talking of? I have never
been engaged—never since’—and then I
halted, fearing what my revelation might
suggest to him.</p>

<p>‘What do you tell me?’ he exclaimed.
‘What object have you in deceiving me?
Were you not engaged, even before your
parents’ death, to young Hassell, of Fairmead,
and was it not by his father’s means
that your present situation was procured
for you? I little thought to meet you
here,’ he added bitterly. ‘I imagined you
were married long ago, or I should have
been more careful of my own feelings.
And now you are engaged for the third
time! How easily life runs for some
people!’</p>

<p>‘Who could have told you such a falsehood?’
I said, turning to him. ‘It is true
that old Mr Hassell stood my friend when
I had not one in the world, and that he
found my present situation for me; but as
to being engaged to his son, why, he is
a married man—he married my own
cousin.’</p>

<p>‘Could the mistake have arisen so?’
said Bruce Armytage, as he seized my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
hand. ‘Oh, Lizzie, do not be angry;
think what I have gone through! When
I returned home from that wretched foreign
tour, during which I was not allowed to
correspond with you, the first news which
I heard from my own family was, that
your father and mother had died some
eighteen months before, and that you were
engaged to Robert Hassell, and living with
some old lady (no one could tell me where)
until the time for your marriage arrived.
I would not believe them; I rushed down
to Fairmead myself to make inquiries, and
reached there on the very day of young
Hassell’s wedding with Miss Lacy. Do
you think I was a coward not to stop and
see the bride, believing her to be yourself?
Perhaps I was; but I flew from the spot
as though I had been haunted; and I
suffered—ah, Lizzie, I cannot tell how
much! It is so fearful, so awful a thing
to teach one’s self to believe the heart in
which we have trusted to be faithless and
unworthy.’</p>

<p>‘I know it,’ I said in a low voice, which
was nearly choked by my tears.</p>

<p>‘How I have lived since that time I can
hardly tell you,’ he continued as he pressed
my hand. (I knew it ought not to remain
in his, but it was so sweet to feel it there.)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
‘I have had very little hope, or peace, or
happiness, though I have struggled on
through it all, and made myself a name in
my profession. And then to meet you
again to-night so unexpectedly, still free,
but promised to another, myself and my
love so evidently forgotten, and to feel
that it has been but a chance that separated
us! Oh! Lizzie, it is almost harder than
it was at first!’</p>

<p>‘I am not engaged,’ I answered, sobbing;
‘you choose to take my words at the piano
as meaning so, but it was your mistake,
not mine. I have lived much in the
manner you describe yourself to have done—not
very happily, perhaps, and finding
my best relief in work. But I am glad to
have met you, Bruce—glad to have heard
from your own lips what parted us; and I
thank you for this explanation, though it
comes too late.’</p>

<p>‘But why too late, my dearest?’ he
exclaimed joyfully. ‘Why, if you are free
to accept my hand, and can forgive all
that has made us so unhappy in the past,
should we not bury our mutual trouble in
mutual love? Oh, Lizzie, say that you’ll
be mine—say that you’ll be my own wife,
and help me to wipe out the remembrance
of this miserable mistake!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>I thought of Amy. I looked at him
with astonishment; I recoiled from him
almost with disgust. Was I to accept
happiness at the expense of that of my
dear friends, of the only creatures who had
shown me any affection during my long
years of exile from him? Oh no. I
would rather perish in my solitude. The
very fact that he could propose it to me
made him sink lower in my estimation.</p>

<p>‘Bruce,’ I exclaimed, ‘you must be
mad, or I am mad so to tempt you from
your duty. Think of all your offer involves—of
the distress, the disappointment,
the shame it would entail on those who
have been more than friends to me; and
consider if it is likely I could be so dishonourable
to them as to take advantage
of it.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t understand you, my darling,’
he said, with a puzzled look.</p>

<p>‘Not understand?’ I reiterated, in
surprise, ‘when your engagement to Amy
Rodwell was only settled this morning,
and the preliminaries for your marriage
are already being talked of! Would you
break her heart in the attempt to heal
mine? Bruce, we must never see each
other again after this evening.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Lizzie, Lizzie!’ he said, shaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
his head, ‘we are playing at dreadful cross-purposes.
Did it never enter into your
wise little pate to inquire <i>which</i> Mr Armytage
was going to marry Amy Rodwell?
I can assure you I have no desire or intention
to risk getting a pistol-shot through
my heart for stepping into my cousin
Frederick’s shoes.’</p>

<p>‘And is it really—is it really, then,
<i>Frederick</i> whom she is going to marry?’
I exclaimed, breathless with the shock of
this new intelligence. ‘Oh, how can she?’</p>

<p>‘It is indeed,’ he answered, laughing.
‘Lizzie, did you seriously think that it was
I? Why, what a taste you must give me
credit for, to choose that pretty little piece
of white-and-pink china, after having had
the chance of such a woman as yourself!
And now, what is my answer?’</p>

<p>What it was I leave for my readers to
guess. Let those who have thirsted until
life’s blood lay as dry dust in their veins,
thrust the chalice of sparkling wine from
their parched lips if they will: I am not
made of such stern stuff as that.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The death of a child is at all times
a subject of mournful interest:
it is so sad to see the hereditary
curse falling on the innocent
heads of those who in themselves have
done nothing to merit the punishment of
sin. But when the lost child is an only
child, or an only son, our sympathies with
the bereavement are increased tenfold; so
proud do we know each other to be, of
perpetuating the frailties of which we are
but too conscious, and leaving behind us
an inheritor of the misery we have endured.
And if ordinary children (of which a few
hundreds more or less in the world make
little difference) are to be thus bewailed,
what words can paint strongly enough the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
condolence with which we should approach
the subject of that royal parent who so
lately lost at one stroke his only son, and
(in the direct line) the sole heir to his
throne! The interest felt by all Englishmen
in the royal family of Belgium lies
deeper than in the mere fact of their near
connection with our own Sovereign and her
lamented consort. From the time that the
first Leopold came over, a gallant bridegroom,
to our shores, to wed the Princess
Charlotte (that darling of the nation), and
left them so shortly afterwards widowed
and childless, we have taken almost as
keen an interest in all that concerned him
and his children as though death had never
stepped in to sever the link between us.
And this feeling has been warmly kept up
as much by the condescension with which
Leopold II. has followed in the footsteps
of his father, by taking an interest in all
things British, and showing the utmost
courtesy to, and consideration for, the
foreigners of that nation residing in his
dominions, as by the intimate relations
maintained between the royal families of
England and Belgium.</p>

<p>It may be said, then, and without exaggeration,
that when the sad news that the
young Duc de Brabant had at last succumbed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
to the cruel malady which had
kept him in constant suffering, and the
nation’s hopes in a state of fluctuation for
nine months past, was disseminated
throughout Brussels, his royal parents received
as much sympathy in their sorrow
from the English residents in that capital
as from their own people. The Belgians
mourned their future king; but we wept
with the father and mother over the cradle
of their only son.</p>

<p>The loss was not an ordinary one, for
the child was not an ordinary child; and
this assertion is made, not from newspaper
gleanings, but the report of those who
knew him intimately. His photograph
confirms this fact; for the calm, sensible
face depicted there has none of the careless,
laughter-loving expression which characterises
his age; although when in health
the Duc de Brabant is said to have been
as playful and merry as other little children.
But sickness came too soon to rob his
features of all but the serene patience which
became habitual to them, and before any
change could arrive to restore their original
expression he has passed away from
amongst us, and nothing remains to recall
his memory but the few words which can be
written of so innocent and uneventful a life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>Leopold-Ferdinand-Elie-Victor-Albert-Marie,
Duc de Brabant, Comte de Hainaut,
and Duc de Saxe, was born at the palace
of Laeken, on the 12th of June 1859. He
was the second child of his parents, after
ten years of wedded life, consequently his
birth was hailed with all the greater acclamation
for fulfilling hope deferred to the
hearts of his people. When born, he had
every appearance of possessing a robust
constitution, being plump and well made,
with broad shoulders and an open chest;
with a formation, in fact, containing the
promise of so much muscular strength, that
the obstinate ravages of the fatal disease
which has taken him from us have been a
matter of surprise to all who knew the
child as he once was.</p>

<p>The method of his bringing up, also, and
the careful manner in which his studies
and employments were regulated, should
have tended to increase, rather than detract
from, the bodily health which he bid fair
to enjoy. His education, entrusted to M.
le Comte Vanderstraeten-Ponthoz, and to
Monsieur le Lieutenant Donny, was skilfully
directed in such a way as to maintain
a wholesome equilibrium between the development
of his physical force and that of
the brilliant mental faculties with which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
the young prince was gifted. The employment
of his time was carved out with the
greatest minuteness, and out-door exercises
alternated with mental labour so as to procure
for both mind and body the repose
they needed. The prince invariably left
his bed at six in summer, and seven in
winter, and breakfasted an hour after he
rose; when he worked with his tutor till
ten o’clock. A run in the park or a ride
on his pony served him for recreation;
and at one he joined his father and mother
at luncheon—a meal which the king and
queen always took <i>en famille</i>. Before
resuming his studies, the little prince went
out again with his tutor, dined at six, and
was then at liberty to amuse himself until
his bed-time, which was fixed for eight
o’clock. Such a life could hurt no one:
no enforced studies were exacted from his
tender brain, nor was the heir of Belgium
sacrificed to the desire to see him turn out
a prodigy; he lived as other happy and
well-cared-for children live, making his
short life one long holiday; and, until
within ten months of his decease, showed
no symptoms whatever of ill-health.</p>

<p>Then the first signs of sickness, said to
be consequent on the suppression of some
childish disorder, became apparent, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
increased until they culminated in pericarditis,
or inflammation of the membranes of
the heart, the affection which ultimately
destroyed him. At its commencement,
this complaint had all the appearance of a
heavy cold, accompanied by a dry, violent
cough, which was soon followed by a pallid
face and wasted figure, the sure signs of
impoverished blood.</p>

<p>When the first grave consultation had
confirmed the diagnostic of the attendant
physicians, that the pericardium or membrane
of the heart was affected, all the
efforts of science were immediately put in
requisition to arrest the progress of the
evil; but without avail, for they proved
powerless to stay the rapid decline of his
natural powers, by dropsy, the usual effect
of heart disease. The swelling of the
stomach and chest of the poor little invalid
now became enormous; the respiratory
organs no longer performed their office,
and the cough redoubled in intensity. It
became most distressing, scarcely ceasing
day or night; and the gravest fears began to
be entertained for his lungs. The apartments
of the prince, though large and airy,
and situated on the ground floor of the right
wing of the palace of Laeken, and opening
on the park, did not contain sufficient vital<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
air for his need. When it was necessary to
close the windows of the chamber, which was
only done at night (for the suffering child
found no relief except in a free current of
air), servants placed on either side his bed
kept up a continual fanning, and by that
means occasionally gained him a few moments
of repose. Every morning, under
the guardianship of his tutor, Monsieur
Donny, the prince was taken into the park
in a little pony-carriage led by a groom,
and made the tour of the domain four or
five times. Towards the middle of the
journey the pony and servant were changed,
for the promenade was long, and often
occupied several hours; and, occasionally,
the poor father and mother, so soon to be
bereaved, might be seen following on horseback,
and wistfully regarding the little carriage
which held the object of their dearest
hopes. It was a <i>triste</i> and melancholy
procession, and resembled a funeral <i>cortége</i>
more than anything else.</p>

<p>Towards one o’clock the prince would
stop, generally near the aviary of pheasants,
and lunch with his preceptor; for, strange
to say, his appetite, though feeble, never
abandoned him until the very last. Soon
the carriage was again in motion and making
the circuit of the park, for it was only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
by a continual change of air that the poor
child was enabled to breathe with any ease.
The affection of the prince for Monsieur
Donny was incredible. Throughout his
illness he insisted upon his being continually
at his side, would not take his meals
without him, and obliged him to sleep in
his apartments; and Monsieur Donny (although
he had been married but a few
weeks when the first serious symptoms of
illness appeared) never quitted the royal
child for a moment until he was carried
out of the palace of Laeken for the last
time. About the month of October there
appeared to be some amelioration in the
prince’s condition, and hopes were almost
confidently entertained of his ultimate restoration
to health. But these hopes were
of short duration, although the bulletins,
issued daily, fluctuated so much in their
statements that it was difficult to arrive
at a knowledge of the truth. The king
is said to have had no hope from the commencement
of the disorder, and his despair
was proportionately great. His grief was
so profound that he became a mere shadow
of himself; and yet, with that manly fortitude
which resists an open expression of
what it feels, might be seen at all times,
pacing the palace and gardens of Laeken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
with calm dry eyes, but a fixed, mournful
look, which seemed as though he had always
before him a vision of the pitiless
death which was about to strike him in his
tenderest affections.</p>

<p>At night he would constantly rise from
his own bed to go with bare feet and
noiseless step, and hang over the couch
where his child, with angelic patience, was
awaiting his doom. This patience, so calm
as to appear almost unnatural, and which
excites surprise in those who have not
nursed little children through mortal illnesses,
seems to have been a characteristic
of this little child. Numberless anecdotes
have, of course, been related of him during
the last months, many of which are totally
without foundation, but one in particular
was so widely spread that it gained
general credence. It was the fact of his
feigning sleep when suffering great pain
if he heard the approach of his father’s
footstep, lest he should be questioned
relative to his state, and read the disappointment
his answer must have caused.
‘If I pretend to sleep,’ he used to say to
his attendants, ‘my father will think that
I am better.’</p>

<p>But during the daytime his father was
seldom absent from his side, and was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
never weary of trying to extract some
slight support on which to hang hope by
questioning the child as to his feelings
and symptoms. One day, when the little
tragedy was drawing very near its close,
and the prince was suffering from one of
those attacks which so often threatened
to be fatal, the king approached the bed
to learn some news of his condition, and
receiving, for the first time, no reply save
such as was conveyed by the languid,
half-raised eyes.</p>

<p>‘Je vous ennuie, n’est ce pas, mon
enfant!’ he exclaimed; and unable to
control his feelings, rushed away into the
park in order to conceal them.</p>

<p>On Christmas-day the king, in an
attempt, if possible, to distract the child’s
mind, had a large Christmas-tree set up
in the midst of his apartment, made brilliant
with wax tapers, and hung with
numbers of beautiful playthings and other
ornaments calculated to attract one of his
age.</p>

<p>The Duc de Brabant, after having duly
admired the tree and its belongings, and
appearing to take pleasure in examining
and handling the playthings with which
it was laden, asked his attendants to bring
a large box to his bedside; and having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
seen all his presents packed away in it,
gave it to Doctor Henriette (one of his
attendant physicians), and begged him to
distribute its contents amongst the little
invalids in the hospital. This is but one
trait amongst a thousand from which might
have been predicated what sort of king
this child, if spared, would eventually have
made. He was positively adored by the
people of the royal household—those servants
who were under his control; and
by seeing him play at sovereign with
whom one read the natural nobility of
his yet undeveloped character. When
any of his servants had committed a fault
and deserved a reprimand from the officer
on duty, the Duc de Brabant would accuse
himself of the negligence in order to save
the real offender from punishment. He
was nursed throughout his illness by two
Sœurs de Charité, who paid him the utmost
attention, and of whom he became
proportionately fond. It was said that on
the first of January the Duc de Brabant
asked his father for the sum of six thousand
francs: ‘Pour ces deux anges qui me
veillaient.’ This anecdote was afterwards
contradicted; but it possesses at least the
merit of giving the general idea of the
disposition of Leopold-Ferdinand. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
was the most generous little heart possible,
and he would have despoiled himself of
everything to make one creature happy.</p>

<p>On Thursday evening, the twenty-first
of January, when it became known in
Laeken that the prince was really dying,
the whole community was in commotion;
and when towards nine o’clock the report
was spread that all was over, nothing was
to be seen but mournful and downcast
countenances, and the commissioner of
police was forced to reassure the people
by telling them that the child still lived.
These sentiments were but natural, for the
progress of the disease had been suspended
during so many months that the dangerous
state of the royal invalid was but
thoroughly realised. The public had begun
to think that the doctors must be mistaken
in their diagnostics; and thus, when the
bulletins from the palace intimated that
there was a fatal aggravation of the symptoms,
the news could not fail to throw the
whole country into a state of consternation.
The last agony of the unfortunate child
(whose sufferings had been greatly accelerated
ever since the fourteenth of January)
commenced at five in the evening of the
twenty-first, and did not terminate till forty
minutes past twelve, at which time he drew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
his last breath in a long sigh of relief.
MM. Henriette and Wimmer, who had so
assiduously tended the royal child since
the appearance of the disease to which he
succumbed, were summoned to the palace
of Laeken by a despatch from M. le Comte
Vanderstraeten-Ponthoz a few minutes
after the last crisis had commenced, and
did not again quit the bedside of the
invalid, though they had the grief of seeing
all their science powerless to do more than
assist at the last moments of him whose
life but a few months before they had
hoped to save.</p>

<p>From the time the crisis set in, Prince
Leopold-Ferdinand recognised no one,
although his intelligence was not completely
obscured; for when the king or
queen spoke to him, he appeared to
understand what they said, although it
was impossible for him to respond, even
by a gesture, to the loving words which
were lavished upon him. He died, as so
beloved a child should die, between his
father and mother, who, during the last
hours, never quitted his side. In his
chamber at this time were Madame la
Duchesse d’Ursel, mistress of the queen’s
household; Monsieur le Comte Vanderstraeten-Ponthoz,
maréchal of the palace;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
Monsieur Donny, the prince’s preceptor;
MM. Henriette and Wimmer, the two
Sœurs de Charité who had nursed him
through his illness, and the two <i>valets-de-chambre</i>
of the Duc de Brabant. All
were silent, as, awe-stricken, they waited,
in the midst of that calm night, to hear
the rustling wings of the Angel of Death;
and the peaceful solemnity of the last hour
was undisturbed, save by the voice of the
chaplain who recited the prayers for the
dying. Monseigneur le Comte de Flandre,
brother to the king, who had been summoned
to the palace by the same despatch
which had brought MM. Henriette and
Wimmer, arrived there at half-past ten,
and quitted Laeken again at midnight;
he was not, therefore, present at the last
moments of his nephew. It was the same
with Monsieur Devaux, the king’s secretary,
who retired at half-past nine to his own
apartments.</p>

<p>When all was over, and life had finally
quitted the poor little body which had
suffered so much, the father and mother,
one after another, strained the corpse in
their arms, and covered it with kisses, until
the king, desirous of sparing the queen so
mournful a spectacle, led her by force from
the couch where rested the inanimate remains<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
of the sole heir to their crown. On
the morning following his decease the body
of the little prince was completely robed
in white, and placed on the bed in the
chamber where he had died, and which is
next to that in which his grandfather,
Leopold I., drew his last breath. A crown
of white roses, fresh and pure as his own
brief life, was placed on the pillar immediately
above his head, and a little virgin,
with several playthings with which he had
essayed to wile away some of the weary
hours of pain, were placed at the foot of
his couch. An altar was improvised on a
large chest of drawers, placed between
two windows of his bedroom, where a
crucifix hung in the midst of lighted candles,
converting the chamber of death into a temporary
chapel. Here the Sœurs de Charité
watched the dead child through the night,
as they had watched him for so many previous
months.</p>

<p>The body of the little prince was not
embalmed, as the queen steadfastly set her
face against such a proceeding, but was interred
in the same condition in which he
had died. The corpse was not at all decomposed,
but it was terribly thin. The
face wore the pallor of marble, and was not
at all swollen or otherwise disfigured. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
child appeared to sleep, and so he did, although
the sleep will be eternal. On the
same day the following proclamation was
placed on the walls of the capital:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

council who signed the address in the name
of the entire body.</p>

<p>But the loyal sympathy of the Belgians
did not vent itself in words only. As soon
as the death of their young prince was
officially announced, black flags on the
Belgian colours, smothered in crape, were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
displayed from the balconies of the principal
houses, whilst the fronts of many of
them were completely hung with funereal
drapery, and most of the shops and all
places of amusement were closed. The
ships lying in the Belgian ports lowered
their flags half-mast high, in sign of the
general mourning; and all the principal
families in Brussels, and most of the English
residents appeared in black.</p>

<p>The bells of the cathedral and other
churches kept tolling at intervals during
the first and succeeding days, to announce
the melancholy news; all fêtes and public
rejoicing were suspended, as well as private
balls and concerts; and the ministerial
conferences were adjourned.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the body of the young prince,
which had been watched ever since his
death by the officers of the household, was
placed in a triple coffin, lined with white
silk, in the presence of the king and queen,
the Archbishop of Malines, and several
members of the royal household. This
melancholy ceremony of bidding the last
earthly adieu, is said to have been, as is
natural, the occasion of a most heartrending
scene. The young prince had received the
insignia of the Chevalier de la Toison d’Or
d’Espagne, shortly after the ascension of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
his father Leopold II. to the throne; and
this insignia was placed on his coffin during
the funeral obsequies—which were
fixed to take place at eleven o’clock on
Monday, the twenty-fifth; at which time also
was to be performed (according to the rites of
the Roman Catholic religion), in the church
of Notre-Dame at Laeken, the first funeral
mass for the repose of his innocent soul.</p>

<p>Accordingly, before eight o’clock on the
morning of the day appointed, a procession
of people eager to witness the ceremony
lined the road to the church and palace of
Laeken. At the palace, the guests were
received in the rotunda, where they had to
await the arrival of the body, to form themselves
in <i>cortége</i>. Monsieur le Baron
Prisse, adjutant of the Palace, and Monsieur
de Wyckersloth were appointed to
receive them. Only a very few were admitted
into the temporary chapel, where
rested the mortal remains of the little
prince; and which was most tastefully decorated.
The walls and ceiling were
draped with black; an altar had been
erected between the two windows, before
which stood the coffin, supported on a
small black bier. It was covered with a
white pall, embroidered with a large golden
cross, upon which lay a wreath of white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
roses. This erection, lighted by four
gold candelabra on black pedestals, and a
chandelier from the ceiling, under which
the coffin rested, had a very solemn and
imposing effect. On the black drapery
with which the room was hung, were shields
emblazoned with the royal arms. At a
quarter to eleven the clergy arrived. They
consisted of the Archbishop of Malines,
the Bishops of Belgium, accompanied by
their canons and secretaries; the rectors
of the parishes of Laeken and the capital;
several envoys from the provinces, and a
representative of each of the religious
orders now established in Brussels. At
their arrival at the palace, which they
entered two by two, the principal members
of the clergy were admitted into the temporary
chapel, where were already assembled
H.M. the King; H.R.H. the
Comte de Flandre; Monseigneur la Prince
de Ligne; and several officers of the household,
amongst which was Monsieur Donny,
the prince’s tutor, who since the morning
could not be persuaded to quit the remains
of his beloved pupil. After the usual
prayers, the coffin was delivered into the
hands of some of the non-commissioned
officers of the army, and such of the Garde-Civique
as had been deputed to carry it to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
its last resting-place. The coffin was of
black wood, with silver nails and ornaments;
lions’ heads formed the handles,
and a splendid ivory crucifix was on the
lid, but there was no plate, descriptive of
the name or distinctions of the deceased
child.</p>

<p>As soon as the coffin had been placed
on the bier on which it was to be carried,
the white pall with its golden cross was
thrown over it, and the funeral <i>cortége</i> was
set in motion. The pall was held by MM.
les Généraux Chazal and Pletinckx; MM.
Frère-Orban, Minister of Finance, and
Bara, Minister of Justice; Dolez, President
of the Chamber, and Omalius d’Halloy,
President of the Senate.</p>

<p>The king, with the Comte de Flandre,
headed the procession. He was pale, and
appeared sadly changed; his step was slow
and faltering, and he was obliged to lean
for support on the arm of his royal brother.
They were attired in the uniform of lieutenant-generals
of the army, and opposite
to where they wore the ribbon of the Order
of Leopold hung a long black crape scarf.
Both seemed much affected, but the father
had evidently great trouble in keeping back
his tears; and one can well imagine that it
must have been real courage on his part to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
attend the sad ceremony in person. Immediately
after the king and his brother,
who walked behind the little coffin, came
the officers of the household of the king,
queen, and Comte de Flandre; the ambassadors
or plenipotentiary ministers of
the various Powers, the generals of the
army, and several other persons of distinction.</p>

<p>Amongst the representatives of the different
Powers were two special envoys:
these were M. de Jamund, aide-de-camp of
the Prince Royal of Prussia, to represent
his Prussian Majesty; and M. Schreckenstein,
who did the same for the Prince of
Hohenzollern. It was painful to see M.
Donny, who formed part of the melancholy
procession: his face bore such evident
traces of the suffering he had passed
through; and when the mortal remains of
the little prince passed him in leaving the
palace, he burst into tears. This long
<i>cortége</i> was brought up at the rear by the
invited guests and clergy already enumerated,
after which came an empty hearse:
first an ordinary one, of which the drapery
had been exchanged for ornaments of black
and gold, and escutcheons, with the Belgian
lion placed on each side of the seat;
whilst six horses, caparisoned with black,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
their heads surmounted with plumes, drew
the funeral car. The dead child’s little
pony, sitting astride which he had been
photographed in various positions, covered
with crape and led by two grooms, followed
the hearse; and twelve court carriages,
their lamps enveloped in crape, and their
coachmen in deep mourning, came after it.
In this order, preceded and followed by
troops of horse, as guards of honour, the
procession slowly wended its way towards
the church by Montagne du Tonnerre.
Its departure from the palace was proclaimed
by volleys of artillery, which continued
throughout the ceremony, and indeed
from daybreak canons fired at intervals,
had announced the coming solemnity;
first, every half-hour, and afterwards, every
five minutes. The bells of all the churches,
also of the capital and its suburbs did not
cease tolling until the funeral obsequies of
the young prince were completed. At the
gate of the palace a company of Grenadiers
presented arms to the coffin, and a little
farther on the barrack-guard went through
the same ceremony. Along the whole
length of the road was assembled a silent
crowd: at every window appeared eager
and interested faces, amongst whom was a
large number of women,—all dressed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
deep mourning, and many weeping. It
was reckoned, and without exaggeration,
that more than forty thousand people went
to Laeken that day to see the child of their
king buried. From the palace to the
church the <i>coup d’œil</i> of the procession was
very imposing.</p>

<p>A veil of black seemed to hover over
the vast multitude, who, with uncovered
heads, paced slowly beneath the wintry
sky; and the rays of frosty sunshine,
powerless as they were to warm on such
a day, had yet sufficient brilliancy to outshine
the lights which flickered in a sickly
manner in the carriage lamps, overshadowed
by their coverings of crape.</p>

<p>When the coffin arrived at the church,
it was already nearly filled with the functionaries
of the different administrations of
Brussels and the provinces. There were
also representatives of all the constituted
bodies, most of the governors of the
province, and deputations of the communal
and provincial councils. MM. le Capitaine
Nicaise and Lahure, junior, were appointed
to keep order in the church; and the places
for each body of functionaries were marked
beforehand by printed bills. The king
and the Comte de Flandre occupied seats
in front of the altar; those belonging to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
their households sat behind. The diplomatic
body was to the right of the bier,
on which rested the coffin—the various
deputations to the left; and all the rest
of the assemblage were disposed in the
two aisles of the church.</p>

<p>The building was completely hung with
black: each pillar bore an escutcheon, in
the centre of which was blazoned a golden
lion, surmounted by the word ‘Obiit,’ and
the date of the child’s death. The bier,
placed in the middle of the church, and
at the entrance of the choir, was raised
upon a pedestal covered with black velvet,
bordered with ermine and embroidered
with lions. The bier itself was covered
with a white pall, on the top of which
was placed a wreath of roses, just like the
one which lay upon the coffin whilst in
the temporary chapel, and was surmounted
by a black canopy bordered with heavy
gold fringe, from which fell four large
curtains, enveloping the pedestal. Round
the coffin burned numerous wax tapers,
and on the four panels of this funereal
erection, and at each corner of the altar,
were the royal arms of Belgium. The
Archbishop of Malines was the principal
officiator at the ceremony, and it was he
who pronounced the Absolution, standing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
beneath a canopy of crimson velvet fringed
with gold, which had been raised for him,
to the right of the altar. The suffragan
bishops took a part in the service; but
the mass was sung.</p>

<p>Directly it was concluded, the coffin was
placed in the chapel in front of the vault
where King Leopold I. and Queen Marie-Louise
already rest, and there it will remain
until the three coffins can be together
moved to the permanent vault in course
of erection in the new church at Laeken.</p>

<p>Then the king came forward, and, having
placed on the coffin of his child a wreath
of white flowers, left the church to return
to the palace. He was terribly moved,
and had difficulty in restraining his tears
until he should have regained his carriage.</p>

<p>The Mass for the Dead was then resumed,
and lasted for an hour and a-half;
and it was two hours before the funeral
ceremonies were finally completed.</p>

<p>On the following Wednesday, the church
of Ste Gudule and St Michel at Brussels,
having been hung in the same lavish
manner with black and white, a second
Grand Mass was said and sung there for
the repose of the little prince’s soul; and
then the whole business was over, and
people began to talk of something else.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
But it will be a long time before Belgium
forgets her Prince Royal or the bereavement
of her king.</p>

<p>The funeral was, perhaps, as grand a
one as ever was given for a child, and
the decorations of the churches, biers, and
coffin, things to be remembered; but the
way in which true Belgians will love best
to think of Leopold-Ferdinand, Duc de
Brabant, will be the recollection, treasured
by his father and mother—the recollection
of a pure dead face, freed from all suffering
and pain, lying on its once familiar bed,
a little virgin clasped in the inanimate
hand, and a wreath of white roses laid
upon the pillow; but above all, of a happy
soul freed from the suffering of sin, and
in the enjoyment of a kingdom from the
possession of which the temptations attendant
upon wearing an earthly crown might
have debarred him.</p>

<p class="dropcap">I am going to tell you a story which
is as improbable an one as you
have ever heard. I do not expect
anybody to believe it; yet it
is perfectly true. The ignorant and bigoted
will read it to the end perhaps, and then
fling it down with the assertion that it is
all nonsense, and there is not one word
of truth in it. The wiser and more experienced
may say it is very wonderful and
incredible, but still they know there are
more things in heaven and earth than are
dreamt of in their philosophy. But no one
will credit it with a hearty, uncompromising
belief. And yet neither ridicule nor incredulity
can alter the fact that this is a
true history of circumstances that occurred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
but a few years since, and to persons who
are living at the present time.</p>

<p>The scene is laid in India, and to India,
therefore, I must transplant you in order
that you may be introduced to the actors
in this veracious drama, premising that
the names I give, not only of people but
of places, are all fictitious.</p>

<p>It is Christmas time in a single station
on the frontiers of Bengal, and a very dull
Christmas the members of the 145th
Bengal Muftis find it in consequence. For
to be quartered in a single station means
to be compelled to associate with the same
people day after day and month after
month and year after year; and to carry
on that old quarrel with Jones, or to listen
to the cackle of Mrs Robinson, or be
bored with the twaddle of Major Smith,
without any hope of respite or escape, and
leaving the gentlemen out of the question,
the ladies of the 145th Bengal Muftis are
not in the best frame of mind at the time
my story opens to spend the day of peace
and goodwill towards men together.
Regimental ladies seldom are. They
are quarrelsome and interfering, and backbiting
enough towards each other in an
English garrison town, but that is a trifle
compared to the way in which they carry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
on in our outlying stations in India. And
yet, the ladies of the 145th Bengal Muftis
are not bad specimens of the sex, taken
individually. It is only when they come
in contact that their Christian love and
charity make themselves conspicuous. Mrs
Dunstan, the wife of the colonel, is the
most important of them all, and the most
important personage, too, in this little
story of a misfortune that involved herself,
therefore let Mrs Dunstan be the first to
advance for inspection.</p>

<p>As we meet her, she is seated in a
lounging chair in her own drawing-room,
at Mudlianah, with a decided look of discontent
or unhappiness upon her countenance.
The scene around her would seem
fair enough in the eyes of those who were
not condemned to live in it. Her room is
surrounded by a broad verandah, which is
so covered by creepers as to be a bower of
greenery. Huge trumpet-shaped blossoms
of the most gorgeous hues of purple, scarlet
and orange, hang in graceful festoons about
the windows and open doorways, whilst
the starry jessamine and Cape honeysuckle
fill the air with sweetness. Beyond the
garden, which is laid out with much taste,
though rather in a wild and tangled style,
owing to the luxuriance of the vegetation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
lie a range of snowy hills which appear
quite close in the transparent atmosphere,
although in reality they are many miles
away.</p>

<p>Mrs Dunstan’s room is furnished, too,
with every luxury as befits the room of a
colonel’s wife, even in an up country
station. The chairs and sofas are of
carved ebony wood, and cane work from
Benares; the table is covered with flowers,
books, and fancy work; a handsome piano
stands in one corner; the floor is covered
with coloured matting, and in the verandah
are scattered toys from various countries, a
token that this comfortable home does not
lack the chief of married joys, a child-angel
in the house.</p>

<p>The mistress, too, is still young and still
handsome, not wanting the capacity for
intellectual nor the health for physical enjoyment,
there must be some deeper reason
than outward discomfort therefore for that
sad far-away look in her eyes and the pain
which has knitted her brow. Yes, ‘Mees
Mar-gie MacQueerk’ (as she would style
herself) has been giving Mrs Dunstan an
hour of her company that morning, and
as usual left her trail behind her.</p>

<p>‘Mees Margie’ is a tall, quaint, ill-favoured
Scotchwoman on the wrong side<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
of fifty, who has come out to India to keep
the house of her brother, the doctor of the
145th. She is a rigid Presbyterian, with
a brogue as uncompromising as her doctrine
and a judgment as hard as nails. Never
having been tempted to do anything wrong,
she is excessively virtuous, and has an eye
like a hawk for the misdoings of others;
indeed, she is so excellent a detective that
she discovers the sins before the sinners
have quite made up their minds to commit
them. She is the detestation of the regiment,
and the colonel’s wife has been
compelled in consequence to show Miss
MacQuirk more attention than she would
otherwise have done to make up for the
neglect of the others. For never does
Miss Maggie pass half-an-hour without
hinting at a fresh peccadillo on the part of
somebody else. She has a rooted conviction
that all soldiers are libertines, not
fit to be trusted out of sight of their wives
or sisters, and if she has no new misdemeanour
to relate on the part of the
masters, the servants are sure to come in
for their share of abuse, and so Miss
Maggie MacQuirk manages to find food
for scandal all the year round. Ethel
Dunstan ought to know her foibles well
enough to mistrust her by this time, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
had the doctor’s sister come in with some
new story of young Freshfield’s flirting,
on Mr Masterman’s card-playing, she
would have been as ready as ever to laugh
at the old Scotchwoman’s mountainous
molehills, and to assure her she was utterly
mistaken. But Miss MacQuirk’s discourse
this morning had taken a different turn.
She had talked exclusively of the latest
arrival in Mudlianah: lovely Mrs Lawless,
who has just returned with her husband,
Jack Lawless, from staff duty in the Northwest
Provinces, and how her beauty seemed
to have addled the heads of all the men
of the 145th Bengal Muftis. And there
was a great deal of truth in Miss MacQuirk’s
assertions, and that is what has
made them go home to the heart of
Ethel Dunstan. We are all so ready to
believe anything that affects our own
happiness.</p>

<p>‘Deed, and it’s jeest freetful,’ said Miss
Margie, in her provincial twang, ‘to see a
set o’ dunderheids tairned the wrang way
for the sake o’ a wee bit o’ a pasty face
wi’ two beeg eyes in the meedle o’ it. It’s
eno’ to mak’ a God-fearing woman praise
the Laird that has kept her in the straight
path. For I’ll no affairm that it’s by mee
ain doin’ that I can haud up my heed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
day with the Queen o’ England herself if
need be.’</p>

<p>‘But Mrs Lawless is very, <i>very</i> lovely—there
cannot be two opinions on that
subject,’ cried generous-hearted Mrs Dunstan.
‘For my own part I never saw a
more beautiful face than hers, and my
husband says just the same thing.’</p>

<p>‘Eh! I nae doot it! The cairnal’s
heed is tairned like all the rest o’ them.
But he cannot ca’ it reet that men should
rin after a leddy that has a lawfu’ meeried
husband o’ her ain.’</p>

<p>‘But you have such strange notions,
Miss MacQuirk. If a gentleman shows
a lady the least attention you call it
“running after her.” We are like one
family shut up in this little station by
ourselves. If we are not to be on friendly
terms with each other, we are indeed to be
pitied.’</p>

<p>‘Friendly tairms,’ exclaimed Miss Margie.
‘Do you call it “friendly tairms” to be
walking in the dairk with anither mon’s
wife? An’ that’s jeest what my gude
brother saw yester e’en as he was comin’
hame fra’ mess.’</p>

<p>‘What man! whose wife?’ asked Ethel
Dunstan, for once interested in Miss MacQuirk’s
scandal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span></p>

<p>‘Aye! I dinna ken the mon, but the
leddy was Mrs Lawless hersel’. And her
husband was at the mess the while, for
Andrew left him at the table, and he was
comin’ home in the dark and he saw Mrs
Lawless in her gairden at the dead o’ neet
walkin’ with a strange mon—a tall mon,
and stout, and not unlike the cairnal,
Andrew says.’</p>

<p>‘What nonsense; Charlie was back from
mess by eleven o’clock,’ said Mrs Dunstan,
with an air of annoyance. ‘When you
repeat such stories, Miss MacQuirk, be
good enough to keep my husband’s name
out of them, or you may get into trouble.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, well, Mrs Dunstan, I only mentioned
that it was like the cairnal. Doubtless
he was at mess or at home the while.
It was half-past ten when Andrew retairned.
But it is hairdly reet that Mrs Lawless
should be walking in her gairden at that
hour o’ neet and with anither mon than
her husband. I doot but one should infairm
Mr Lawless of the caircumstance.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I advise you not to be the one,’
replied Ethel Dunstan, tartly. ‘Jack
Lawless is considered a fire-eater amongst
men, and I don’t think he would spare the
woman even who tried to take away his
wife’s character.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<p>‘Eh, Mrs Doonstan, who talks o’ takin’
awa’ her character? I doot it’s but little
she’s got, puir thing, and it ’twould be a sin
to rob her o’ it. But it’s a terrible thing
to see how gude luiks air rated abuve guid
deeds, and enough to mak’ all honest men
thank the Laird who has presairved them
fra the wiles o’ the enemy. And now I’ll
wish you the gude mairnin, Mrs Doonstan,
for I have several other calls to pay before
tiffin.’</p>

<p>And so the old scandal-monger had left
the colonel’s wife in the condition in which
we found her.</p>

<p>Of course if there had been no more truth
in it than in the generality of Miss MacQuirk’s
stories Ethel Dunstan would
have laughed at and forgotten it. But
there is just sufficient probability of its
being a fact to give a colouring to the
matter.</p>

<p>For Mrs Lawless is not a woman that
the most faithful husband in creation could
look at without some degree of interest,
and Colonel Dunstan being guileless of
harm, has expressed his admiration of her
in the most open manner. She is a graceful,
fairy-like creature, of two or three-and-twenty,
in the flush of youth and beauty,
and yet with sufficient knowledge of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
world to render her the most charming
companion. She has a complexion like
a rose leaf, a skin as white as milk, large
limpid hazel eyes, a pert nose, a coaxing
mouth, and hair of a sunny brown. Fancy
such a woman alighting suddenly in an
out-of-the-way, dull, dried-up little hole of
a station like Mudlianah, and in the midst
of some twenty inflammable British officers!
You might as well have sent a mitrailleuse
amongst them for the amount of damage
she did. They were all alight at the first
view of her, and hopelessly burned up
before the week was over. She is devoted
to her Jack, and has in reality no
eyes nor thoughts except for him; but he
has become a little used to her charms,
after the manner of husbands, and so she
flirts with the rest of the regiment indiscriminately,
and sheds the light of her
countenance on all alike, from the colonel
downwards. The wives of the 145th Bengal
Muftis have received Mrs Lawless but
coldly. How can they look into her heart
and see how entirely it is devoted to her
husband? All they see is her lovely,
smiling face, and contrasting it with their
own less beautiful and somewhat faded
countenances, they imagine that no man
can be proof against her fascinations, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
jealousy reigns supreme in the 145th with
regard to Cissy Lawless.</p>

<p>Ethel Dunstan has no need to fear a
rival in her colonel’s heart, because she
possesses every atom of his affection, and
he has proved it by years of devotion and
fidelity, but when a woman is once jealous
of another, she forgets everything except
the fear of present loss. Colonel Dunstan
is vexed when he comes in that morning
from regimental duty to find his wife pale
and dispirited, still more so to hear the
tart replies she makes to all his tender
questioning.</p>

<p>‘Are you not well, my darling?’ he
asks.</p>

<p>‘Quite well, thank you; at least as
well as one can be in a hole like Mudlianah.
Charlie! where have you been
this morning?’</p>

<p>‘Been, dear? Why, to mess and barracks,
to be sure! Where else should I
have been?’</p>

<p>‘There are plenty of houses to call at, I
suppose. What is the use of pretending
to be so dull? You made a call late last
night, if I am not much mistaken!’</p>

<p>‘Last night! What, after mess? I
only went home with Jack Lawless for a
minute or two.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>‘Did you go home with Mr Lawless?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; at least—he didn’t walk home
with me exactly; but he came in soon
afterwards.’</p>

<p>‘Of course she was in bed?’</p>

<p>‘Oh no, she wasn’t. She was as brisk as
a bee. We talked together for a long time.’</p>

<p>‘So I have heard! In the garden,’ remarks
Mrs Dunstan pointedly.</p>

<p>‘Yes! Was there any harm in that?’
replies her husband. ‘Our talk was solely
on business. Is anything the matter, Ethel,
darling? You are not at all like yourself
this morning.’</p>

<p>But the only answer Mrs Dunstan gives
him is indicated by her suddenly rising
and leaving the room. She is not the
sort of woman to tell her husband frankly
what she feels. She thinks—and perhaps
she is right—that to openly touch so delicate
a matter as a dereliction from the path
of marital duty, is to add fuel to the flame.
But she suffers terribly, and in her excited
condition Colonel Dunstan’s open avowal
appears an aggravation of his offence.</p>

<p>‘He is too noble to deceive me,’ she
thinks, ‘and so he will take refuge in
apparent frankness. He confesses he admires
her, and he will tell me every time
he goes there, and then he will say,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>‘How can you suspect me of any wrong
intention when I am so open with you?’</p>

<p>‘Business indeed! As if he could have
any business with a doll like Mrs Lawless.
It is shameful of her to flirt with married
men in this disgraceful way.’</p>

<p>Yet Mrs Dunstan and Mrs Lawless
meet at the band that evening, and smile
and bow to and talk with one another as if
they were the best friends in the world;
but the colonel is prevented by duty from
doing more than arrive in time to take his
wife home to dinner, and so Ethel’s heart
is for the while at rest. But during dinner
a dreadful blow falls upon her. A note is
brought to the colonel, which he reads in
silence and puts into the pocket of his
white drill waistcoat.</p>

<p>‘From Mr Hazlewood, dear?’ says
Ethel interrogatively.</p>

<p>‘No, my love, purely on business,’
replies the colonel, as he helps himself to
wine. But when the meal is concluded
he walks into his dressing-room, and reappears
in his mess uniform.</p>

<p>‘Going to mess, Charlie?’ exclaims his
wife, in a tone of disappointment.</p>

<p>‘No, my darling—business! I may be
late. Good-night!’ and he kisses her and
walks out of the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>‘Business!’ repeats Mrs Dunstan emphatically;
and as soon as his back is
turned, she is searching his suit of drill.
Colonel Dunstan has not been careful to
conceal or destroy the note he received at
dinner. It is still in his waistcoat pocket.
His wife tears it open and reads:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dear Colonel</span>,—Do come over this
evening if possible. I have had another
letter, which you must see. I depend
upon you for everything. You are the
only friend I have in the world. Pray
don’t fail me.—Ever yours gratefully,</p>

<p class="right">
‘<span class="smcap">Cissy Lawless</span>.’<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>‘Cat!’ cries Mrs Dunstan indignantly,
‘deceitful, fawning, hypocritical cat! This
is the way she gets over the men—pretending
to each one that he is the only
friend she has in the world—a married
woman, too! It’s disgusting! Miss MacQuirk
is quite right, and some one ought
to tell poor Jack Lawless of the way she is
carrying on. And Charlie is as bad as she
is! It was only to-day he told me as bold
as brass that that creature’s eyes are so
innocent and guileless-looking they reminded
him of little Katie’s—and not ten minutes
afterwards, he said my new bonnet from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
England was a fright, and made me look
as yellow as a guinea. Oh! what is this
world coming to, and where will such
wickedness end? I wish that I was dead
and buried with poor mamma.’ And so
Mrs Dunstan cries herself to sleep, and
when her husband comes home and kisses
her fondly as she lies upon the pillow, he
decides that she is feverish, and has not
been looking well lately and must require
change, and remains awake for some time
thinking how he can best arrange to let
her have it.</p>

<p>In the middle of that night, however,
something occurs to occupy the minds of
both father and mother to the exclusion of
everything else. Little Katie, their only
child, a beautiful little girl of three years
old, is taken suddenly and dangerously ill
with one of those violent disorders that
annually decimate our British possessions
in the east. The whole household is
roused—Dr MacQuirk summoned from his
bed—and for some hours the parents hang
in mental terror over the baby’s cot, fearing
every minute lest their treasure should
be taken from them. But the crisis passes.
Little Katie is weak but out of danger,
and then the consideration arises what is
the best thing to facilitate her recovery.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
Dr MacQuirk lets a day or two pass to
allow the child to gain a little strength, and
then he tells the colonel emphatically that
she must be sent away at once—to England
if possible—or he will not answer for
her life. This announcement is a sad blow
to Colonel Dunstan, but he knows it is
imperative, and prepares to break the news
to his wife.</p>

<p>‘Ethel, my dear, I am sorry to tell you
that MacQuirk considers it quite necessary
that Katie should leave Mudlianah for
change of air, and he wishes her, if possible,
to go to England at once.’</p>

<p>‘But it is <i>not</i> possible, Charlie. We could
never consent to send the child home alone,
and you cannot get leave again so soon.
Surely it is not absolutely necessary she
should go to England.’</p>

<p>‘Not absolutely necessary, perhaps, but
very advisable, not only for Katie, but for
yourself. You are not looking at all well,
Ethel. Your dispirited appearance worries
me sadly, and in your condition you should
take every care of yourself. I hardly like
to make the proposal to you, but if you
would consent to take Katie home to your
sister’s, say for a twelvemonth, I think it
would do your own health a great deal of
good.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<p>But Colonel Dunstan’s allusion to her
want of spirits has recalled all her jealousy
of Mrs Lawless to Ethel’s mind, and the
journey to England finds no favour in her
eyes.</p>

<p>‘You want me to go away for a twelvemonth,’
she says sharply, ‘and pray what
is to become of you meanwhile?’</p>

<p>‘I must stay here. You know I cannot
leave India.’</p>

<p>‘You will stay with Mrs—, I mean
with the regiment, whilst I go home with
the child.’</p>

<p>‘Yes. What else can I do?’</p>

<p>‘Then I shall <i>not</i> go. I refuse to leave
you.’</p>

<p>‘Not even for Katie’s sake?’</p>

<p>‘We will take her somewhere else.
There are plenty of places in India where
we can go for change of air; and if you
<i>cared</i> for me, Charlie, you would never
contemplate such a thing as a whole year’s
separation.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think I <i>like</i> the idea, Ethel?
What should I do left here all by myself?
I only proposed it for your sake and the
child’s.’</p>

<p>‘I will not go,’ repeats Mrs Dunstan,
firmly, and she sends for Dr MacQuirk
and has a long talk with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<p>‘Dr MacQuirk, is it an absolute necessity
that Katie should go to England?’</p>

<p>‘Not an absolute neeceessity, my dear
leddy, but, from a mee-dical point of
view, advisable. And your own hee-alth
also—’</p>

<p>‘Bother my health!’ she cries irreverently.
‘What is the nearest place to which
I could take the child for change?’</p>

<p>‘You might take her to the heels, Mrs
Doonstan—to the heels of Mandalinati,
which are very salubrious at this time of
the year.’</p>

<p>‘And how far off are they?’</p>

<p>‘A matter of a coople of hundred miles.
Ye canna get houses there, but there is a
cairs-tle on the broo’ o’ the heel that ye
may have for the airsking.’</p>

<p>‘A castle! that sounds most romantic?
And whom must we ask, doctor?’</p>

<p>‘The cairs-tle is the property of Rajah
Mati Singh, and he bee-lt it for his ain
plee-sure, but he doesna’ ceer to leeve
there, and so he will lend it to any Europeans
who weesh for a change to the heels
of Mandalinati.’</p>

<p>‘Rajah Mati Singh! That horrid man!
There will be no chance of seeing him, will
there?’</p>

<p>‘No, no, Mrs Doonstan! the Rajah will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
not trouble ye! He never goes near the
cairs-tle noo, and ye will have the whoole
place to yersel’ in peace and quietude.’</p>

<p>‘I will speak to the colonel about it
directly he comes in. Thank you for your
information, Dr MacQuirk. If we must
leave Mudlianah, I shall be delighted to
stay for a while at this romantic castle on
the brow of the hill.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ she says to herself, when the
doctor is gone, ‘we shall be alone there,
I and my Charlie, and it will seem like the
dear old honeymoon time, before we came
to live amongst these horrid flirting cats of
women, and perhaps some of the old
memories will come back to him and we
shall be happy, foolish lovers again as
we used to be long ago before I was so
miserable.’</p>

<p>But when Colonel Dunstan hears of the
proposed visit to the Mandalinati hills, he
does not seem to approve of it half so much
as he did of the voyage to England.</p>

<p>‘I am not at all sure if the climate will
suit you or the child,’ he says, ‘it is sometimes
very raw and misty up on those hills.
And then it is very wild and lonely. I
know the castle MacQuirk means—a great
straggling building standing quite by itself,
and in a most exposed position. I really<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
think you will be much wiser to go to
England, Ethel.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Charlie! how unkind of you, and
when you know the separation will kill
me!’</p>

<p>‘It would be harder, just at first, but I
should feel our trouble would be repaid.
But I shall always be in a fidget about you
at Mandalinati.’</p>

<p>‘But, Charlie, what harm can happen
when you are with us?’</p>

<p>‘My dear girl, I can’t go with you to
the castle.’</p>

<p>‘Why not?’</p>

<p>‘Because business will detain me here.
How do you suppose I can leave the
regiment?’</p>

<p>‘But you will come up very often to
see us—every week at least; won’t you,
Charlie?’</p>

<p>‘On a four days’ journey! Ethel, my
dear, be reasonable. If you go to Mandalinati,
the most I can promise is to get a
fortnight’s leave after a time, and run up
to see how you and the dear child are
getting on. But I don’t like your going,
and I tell you so plainly. Suppose you
are taken ill before your time, or Katie has
another attack, how are you to get assistance
up on those beastly hills? Think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
better of it, Ethel, and decide on England.
If you go, Captain Lewis says he will send
his wife at the same time, and you would
be nice company for each other on the way
home.’</p>

<p>‘Mrs Lewis, indeed! an empty-headed
noodle! Why, she would drive me crazy
before we were half-way there. No,
Charlie; I am quite decided. If <i>you</i> cannot
accompany me to England, I refuse
to go. I shall get the loan of the castle,
and try what four weeks there will do for
the child.’</p>

<p>And thus it came to pass that Mrs Dunstan’s
absurd jealousy of Mrs Lawless
drives her to spend that fatal month at
the lonely castle on the Mandalinati hills,
instead of going in peace and safety to her
native land. For a brief space Hope
leads her to believe that she may induce
Mrs Lawless to pass the time of exile with
her. If her woman’s wit can only induce
the fatal beauty to become her guest, she
will bear the loss of Charlie’s society with
equanimity. But though Cissy Lawless
seems for a moment almost to yield, she
suddenly draws back, to Mrs Dunstan’s
intense annoyance.</p>

<p>‘The old castle on the hills!’ she exclaimed.
‘Are you and Colonel Dunstan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
really going there? How delightfully romantic!
I believe no end of murders have
been committed there, and every room is
haunted. Oh, I should like to go, too, of
all things in the world! I long to see a
real ghost, only you must promise never
to leave us alone, colonel, for I should
die of fright if I were left by myself.’</p>

<p>‘But I shall not be there, I am sorry to
say,’ replies the colonel. ‘My wife and
Katie are going for change of air, but I
must simmer meanwhile at Mudlianah.’</p>

<p>Pretty Cissy Lawless looks decidedly
dumfoundered, and begins to back out of
her consent immediately. ‘I pity you,’
she answers, ‘and I pity myself too, for I
expect we shall have to simmer together.
I should like it of all things, as I said
before, but Jack would never let me
leave him. He is such a dear, useless
body without me. Besides, as you know,
colonel, I have business to keep me in
Mudlianah.’</p>

<p>Business again! Ethel turns away in
disgust; but it is with difficulty she can
keep the tears from rushing to her eyes.
However, there is no help for it, and she
must go. Her child is very dear to her,
and at all risks it requires mountain air.
She must leave her colonel to take his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
chance in the plains below—only as he
puts her and the child into the transit that
is to convey them to the hills, and bids her
farewell with a very honest falter in his voice
he feels her hot tears upon his cheek.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Charlie, Charlie, be true to me!
Think how I have loved you. I am so
very miserable.’</p>

<p>‘Miserable, my love, and for this short
parting? Come, Ethel, you must be
braver than this. It will not be long
before we meet again, remember.’</p>

<p>‘And, till then, you will be careful,
won’t you, Charlie, for my sake, and think
of me, and don’t go too much from home?
and remember how treacherous women
are; and I am not beautiful, I know, my
darling; I never was, you know,’ with a
deep sob, ‘like—like Mrs Lawless and
others. But I love you, Charlie, I love
you with all my heart, and I have always
been faithful to you in thought as well as
deed.’ And so, sobbing and incoherent,
Ethel Dunstan drives away to the Mandalinati
hills, whilst the good colonel stands
where she left him, with a puzzled look
upon his honest sunburnt face.</p>

<p>‘What does she mean?’ he ponders,
‘by saying she is not beautiful like Cissy
Lawless, and telling me to remember how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
treacherous women are, as if I didn’t know
the jades. Is it possible Ethel can be
jealous—jealous of that poor, pretty little
creature who is breaking her heart about her
Jack? No! that would be too ridiculous,
and too alarming into the bargain; for even
if I can get the boy out of the scrape, it is
hardly a matter to trust to a woman’s discretion.
Well, well, I must do the best I
can, and leave the rest to chance. Ethel
to be jealous! the woman I have devoted my
life to! It would be too absurd if anything
the creatures do can possibly be called so.’</p>

<p>And then he walks off to breakfast with
the Lawlesses, though his heart is rather
heavy, and his spirits are rather dull for
several days after his wife starts for the
castle on the hill. Ethel, on the other
hand, gets on still worse than her husband.
As she lies in her transit, swaying about
from side to side over the rough country
roads, she is haunted by the vision of
Charlie walking about the garden till the
small hours of the morning, hand in hand
with Cissy Lawless, with a mind entirely
oblivious of his poor wife and child, or
indeed of anything except his beautiful
companion. Twenty times would she have
decided that she could bear the strain no
longer, and given the order to return to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
Mudlianah, had it not been for the warning
conveyed in the fretful wailing of her
sickly child—his child—the blossom of
their mutual love. So, for Katie’s sake,
poor Ethel keeps steadfastly to her purpose,
and soon real troubles take the place
of imaginary ones, and nearly efface their
remembrance. She is well protected by a
retinue of native servants, and the country
through which she travels is a perfectly
safe one; yet, as they reach the foot of the
hills up which they must climb to reach
the celebrated castle, she is surprised to
hear that her nurse (or Dye), who has
been with her since Katie’s birth, refuses
to proceed any further, and sends in her
resignation.</p>

<p>‘What do you mean, Dye?’ demands
her mistress with a natural vexation, ‘you
are going to leave Katie and me just as
we require your services most. What
can you be thinking of? You, who have
always professed to be so fond of us both.
Are you ill?’</p>

<p>‘No, missus. I not ill, but I cannot go
up the hill. That castle very bad place,
very cold and big, and bad people live
there and many noises come, and I want
to go back to Mudlianah to my husband
and little children.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span></p>

<p>‘What nonsense, Dye! I didn’t think
you were so foolish. Who has been putting
such nonsense into your head? The castle
is a beautiful place, and you will not feel
at all cold with the warm clothes I have
given you, and we have come here to make
Miss Katie well, you know, and you will
surely never leave her until she is quite
strong again.’</p>

<p>But the native woman obstinately declares
that she will not go on to the Mandalinati
hills, and it is only upon a promise of
receiving double pay that she at last complainingly
consents to accompany her
mistress to the castle. Ethel has to suffer,
however, for descending to bribery, as
before the ascent commences every servant
in her employ has bargained for higher
wages, and unless she wishes to remain in
the plains she is compelled to comply with
their demands. But she determines to
write and tell Charlie of their extortion by
the first opportunity, and hopes that the
intelligence may bring him up, brimming
with indignation, to set her household in
order. Her first view of the castle, however,
repays her for the trouble she has had
in getting there. She thinks she has
seldom seen a building that strikes her
with such a sense of importance. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
formed of a species of white stone that
glistens like marble in the sunshine, and
it is situated on the brow of a jutting hill
that renders it visible for many miles round.
The approach to it is composed of three
terraces of stone, each one surrounded by
mountainous shrubs and hill-bearing flowers,
and Ethel wonders why the Rajah Mati
Singh, having built himself such a beautiful
residence, should ever leave it for the use
of strangers. She understands very little
of the native language, but from a few words
dropt here and there she gathers that the
castle was originally intended for a harem,
and supposes the rajah’s wives found the
climate too cold for susceptible natures. If
they disliked the temperature as much as her
native servants appear to do, it is no wonder
that they deserted the castle, for their
groans and moans and shakings of the head
quite infect their mistress, and make her
feel more lonely and nervous than she
would otherwise have done, although she
finds the house is so large that she can
only occupy a small portion of it. The
dining-hall, which is some forty feet square,
is approached by eight doors below, two
on each side, whilst a gallery runs round
the top of it, supported by a stone balustrade
and containing eight more doors to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
correspond with those on the ground floor.
These upper doors open into the sleeping
chambers, which all look out again
upon open-air verandahs commanding an
extensive view over the hills and plains
below. Mrs Dunstan feels very dismal
and isolated as she sits down to her first
meal in this splendid dining-hall, but after
a few days she gets reconciled to the loneliness,
and sits with Katie on the terraces
and amongst the flowers all day long, praying
that the fresh breeze and mountain air
may restore the roses to her darling’s cheeks.
One thing, however, she cannot make up
her mind to, and that is to sleep upstairs.
All the chambers are furnished, for the
Rajah Mati Singh is a great ally of the
British throne, and keeps up this castle
on purpose to ingratiate himself with the
English by lending it for their use; but
Ethel has her bed brought downstairs, and
occupies two rooms that look out upon the
moonlit terraces. She cannot imagine why
the natives are so averse to this proceeding
on her part. They gesticulate and chatter—all
in double Dutch, as far as she is
concerned—but she will have her own way,
for she feels less lonely when her apartments
are all together. Her Dye goes on
her knees to entreat her mistress to sleep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
upstairs instead of down; but Ethel is
growing tired of all this demonstration
about what she knows nothing, and sharply
bids her do as she is told. Yet, as the
days go on, there is something unsatisfactory—she
cannot tell what—about the
whole affair. The servants are gloomy
and discontented, and huddle together in
groups, whispering to one another. The
Dye is always crying and hugging the child,
while she drops mysterious hints about
their never seeing Mudlianah again, which
make Ethel’s heart almost stop beating,
as she thinks of native insurrections and
rebellions, and wonders if the servants
mean to murder her and Katie in revenge
for having been forced to accompany them
to Mandalinati.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, some mysterious circumstances
occur for which Mrs Dunstan
cannot account. One day, as she is sitting
at her solitary dinner with two natives
standing behind her chairs, she is startled
by hearing a sudden rushing wind, and,
looking up, sees the eight doors in the
gallery open and slam again, apparently
of their own accord, whilst simultaneously
the eight doors on the ground floor which
were standing open shut with a loud noise.
Ethel looks round; the two natives are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
green with fright; but she believes that
it is only the wind, though the evening
is as calm as can be. She orders them
to open the lower doors again, and having
done so, they have hardly returned to
their station behind her chair before the
sixteen doors open and shut as before.
Mrs Dunstan is now very angry; she
believes the servants are playing tricks
upon her, and she is not the woman to
permit such an impertinence with impunity.
She rises from table majestically and leaves
the room, but reflection shows her that the
only thing she can do is to write to her
husband on the subject, for she is in the
power of her servants so long as she
remains at the castle, where they cannot
be replaced.</p>

<p>She stays in the garden that evening,
thinking over this occurrence and its
remedy, till long after her child has been
put to bed—and as she re-enters the
castle she visits Katie’s room before she
retires to her own, and detects the Dye
in the act of hanging up a large black
shawl across the window that looks cut
upon the terrace.</p>

<p>‘What are you doing that for?’ cries
Ethel impetuously, her suspicions ready
to be aroused by anything, however trivial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span></p>

<p>The woman stammers and stutters, and
finally declares she cannot sleep without
a screen drawn before the window.</p>

<p>‘Bad people’s coming and going at night
here!’ she says in explanation, ‘and looking
in at the window upon the child; and
if they touch missy she will die. Missus
had better let me put up curtain to keep
them out. They can’t do me any harm.
It is the child they come for.’</p>

<p>‘Bad people coming at night! What
on earth do you mean, Dye? What people
come here but our own servants? If you
go on talking such nonsense to me I shall
begin to think you drink too much arrack.’</p>

<p>‘Missus, please!’ replies the native with
a deprecatory shrug of the shoulders; ‘but
Dye speaks the truth! A white woman
walks on this terrace every night looking
for her child, and if she sees little missy,
she will take her away, and then you will
blame poor Dye for losing her. Better let
me put up the curtain so that she can’t
look in at window.’</p>
